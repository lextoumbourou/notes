Welcome to my rendered collections of notes.

You can find the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/lextoumbourou/notes).

The notes are collected using my interpretation of the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method. [Permanent Notes](/permanent-notes.html) explore a single idea and its connections to other ideas. Reference notes (based on [Literature Notes](/literature-notes.html)) are taken while consuming the media as a means of helping me process information. The idea is that reference notes lead to additions or updates to the permanent note collection.

I've accumulated notes since 2012 but started using this methodology in 2020.

The notes are currently sorted by their creation date. However, the intention is that each note will be constantly updated and changed. I recommend using the tags to explore the notes.

I intend to be flexible with the topics this blog explores; it's what I'm interested in or learning about at the time. Right now, I'm most interested in Generative AI and Software Engineering. I'm also doing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (I've been working for about 20 years without a degree), so some notes will be on computer science fundamentals.

I don't know how useful the contents of notes will be to others. However, I've made them public because it helps me motivate the creation of these notes, and you never know.

### About me

I'm a generalist software developer currently living in Brisbane, Australia. At the time of writing, I'm the CTO of a Music startup called [Splash](https://www.splashmusic.com/).

I'm a [Kaggle journeyman](https://www.kaggle.com/lextoumbourou/competitions?sort=recently+launched&tab=completed), having achieved ten medals (9 silvers) in a row with no golds. However, I am a [Kaggle Notebook Master](https://www.kaggle.com/lextoumbourou/code?userId=21102&sortBy=voteCount&tab=profile). I'm on a Kaggle hiatus now, but I hope to get back on the wagon soon.

I spent many years working on the Roblox game [Splash](https://www.roblox.com/games/4936591712/SPLASH-Skate-Music#!/game-instances), so you will find game design and Roblox content scattered throughout the blog, though I'm back to focusing on ML now, and not sure I'll go back to game development.

I don't post on social media much, but I'm sometimes on:
