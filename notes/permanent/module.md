A module is a distinct and identifiable unit of code designed to be part of a larger application.

The specific definition of a module varies amongst programming languages and developers.

In Python and similar languages, a module is clearly defined as a file with a .py extension containing code that can be imported and utilised by other modules. In others, a module could refer to a class definition and its associated methods.

The key idea of modularity is to promote code reusability and organisational clarity.

[Module Cohesion](module-cohesion.md) refers to the degree of relation between module elements. [Module Coupling](module-coupling.md) is the degree of interdependence between software modules.
