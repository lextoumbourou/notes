De Morgan's Laws describe how mathematical statements and concepts are related through opposites.

In [[Set]] theory, they refer to the intersenction and union of sets through their complements.



By Augustus De Morgan (1806 - 1871), a British mathematician.
    * De Morgan's laws describe how mathematical statements and concepts are related through opposites.
        * In set theory, De Morgan's laws relate to the intersection and union of sets through their complements.
    * The structure of De Morgan's laws, whether applied to sets, propositions or logic gates is always the same.
    * Law #1: Compliment of union of 2 sets A and B is equal to intersection of complements
        * $\overline{A \bigcup B} = \bar{A} \cap \bar{B}$
            * A = {a, b}, B = {b ,c, d}
            * $\overline{A \bigcup B}$ = $\overline{\{a, b, c, d}\}$ = $\{\}$
            * $\overline{A} = \{c, d\}$, $\overline{B} = \{a\}$,
                * $\overline{A} \cap  \overline{B} = \{\}$, 
    * Law #2: Complement of the intersection of 2 sets A and B, is equal to union of their complements.
        * $\overline{A \cap B} = \bar{A} \bigcup \bar{B}$
            * A = {a, b}, B = {b, c, d}
            * $\overline{A \cap B} = \{a, c, d\}$
            * $\bar{A} \bigcup \bar{B} = \{a, c, d\}$
