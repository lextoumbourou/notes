One of the two methods of story telling in games. The game isn't designed with a specific story, but a unique one is generated each game. The Sims and Minecraft are games that are specifically designed to be story machines. [@schellArtGameDesign2015a] (pg. 229-230)

Sports are another example of this, where a story can be told about the battle between participants.

The opposite of [String of Pearls](string-of-pearls.md) in which a linear, non-interactive story is followed by a player interspersed with periods of free play.
