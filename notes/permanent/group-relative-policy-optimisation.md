Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a reinforcement learning algorithm to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Introduced in the DeepSeekMath paper in the context of mathematical reasoning.
 
GRPO modifies [Proximal Policy Optimization](../../../permanent/proximal-policy-optimization.md) (PPO) by eliminating the need for a value function model.
