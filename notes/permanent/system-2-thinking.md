System 2 thinking is characterized by slow, deliberate, and logical reasoning, requiring conscious effort and attention to solve complex problems. Unlike the intuitive nature of [System 1 Thinking](system-1-thinking.md), System 2 is responsible for critical thinking, reasoning, and decision-making in unfamiliar or challenging situations [^1].
