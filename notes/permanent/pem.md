PEM is a container file format that can include public certificates, or entire concatenated certificate chain including public key, private key and root certificates.

Name comes from [Privacy-Enhanced Mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail), a now obsolete method for securing email. The method was replaced but future protocols, but the container format remains.
