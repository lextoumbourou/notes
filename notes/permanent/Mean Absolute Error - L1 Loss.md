Mean Absolute Difference (MAE) is a function for assessing [[Regression]]. It's also as L1 Loss because it takes the [[L1 Norm]] of the error vector.

### Steps

1. Calculate error vector as **labels** - **predictions**
2. Take the absolute values of the errors
3. Take the mean of all values.

An alternative to [[Root mean-squared error - L2 Loss]].
