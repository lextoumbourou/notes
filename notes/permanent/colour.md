**Colour** refers to the way our brain interprets the different wavelengths of visible light that hit our eyes, creating the rich spectrum of different [Hue](hue.md) values we see in the world around us. Although light is made up of many wavelengths, our eyes only use three types of colour-sensitive cells, known as cones, which respond to red, green, and blue. The brain then blends these signals to produce the full range of colours we perceive.

Various [Colour Space](colour-space.md) examples exist which represent different models of describing individual colours.
