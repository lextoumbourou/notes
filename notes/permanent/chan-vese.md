**Chan-Vese** is an image segmentation algorithm based on active contours without edges, uses regional intensity statistics rather than gradients to evolve a contour that separates distinct regions in an image.

Mimises an energy function to detect object boundaries even when edges are weak or poorlydefined, making it useful for [Mammography](mammography.md) medical images.
