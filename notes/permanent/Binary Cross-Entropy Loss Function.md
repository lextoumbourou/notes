Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE), also known as log loss, is a loss function used in binary or multi-label machine learning training.

It's nearly identical to [[Negative Log-Likelihood]] except it supports any number of positive labels (including zero).

For each value in a set of model outputs, we first apply the [[Sigmoid Activation Function]] before taking `-log(pred)` if the corresponding label is positive or `-log(1-pred)` if negative.

For a single binary output, the function can be expressed as:

{% notebook permanent/notebooks/bce-loss-function.ipynb cells[0:2] %}

Or in math:

$$L(p, y) = ‚àí(\underbrace{y \times log(ùëù)}_{\text{Exp 1}} + \underbrace{(1‚àíùë¶) \times log(1‚àíùëù)}_{\text{Exp 2}})$$ 

Where $p$ is the model's predictions and $y$ is the true label.

Since $y$ will either be $1$ or $0$, $\text{Exp 1}$ or $\text{Exp 2}$ will be 0, ensuring we only keep one $\log$ value. That's equivalent to the `if` statement in code.

For multi-label outputs, the function takes the mean (or sometimes sum) of each of the log values:

{% notebook permanent/notebooks/bce-loss-function.ipynb cells[2:4] %}

That is represented in math as follows:

$$L(P, Y) = ‚àí\frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} (Y_{i} \times log(P_{i}) + (1‚àí Y_{i}) \times log(1‚àí P_{i}))$$

PyTorch provides the function via the [`nn.BCELoss`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BCELoss.html) class. It's the equivalent of [`nn.NLLLoss`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html) in multi-class classification with a single true label per input.

{% notebook permanent/notebooks/bce-loss-function.ipynb cells[4:5] %}

which is equivalent to this function:

{% notebook permanent/notebooks/bce-loss-function.ipynb cells[5:7] %}

Use [`nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss.html) if your model architecture doesn't perform the [[Sigmoid Activation Function]] on the final layer. That's equivalent to [`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html) in PyTorch (see [[Cross-Entropy Loss Function]]).
