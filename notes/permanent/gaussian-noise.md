**Gaussian Noise** is a type of statistical noise that follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution in its probability density function (PDF). Also known as normal noise, it is characterized by random fluctuations that cluster around a mean value, with decreasing probability as values deviate from this mean. This type of noise commonly occurs in electronic systems, digital imaging, and natural phenomena.
