ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard developed in the 1960s that forms the foundation of most modern text encoding systems.

ASCII uses 7 bits to represent each character, allowing for 128 unique values (0-127).

[UTF-8](utf-8.md) one of the encoding standards in [Unicode](unicode.md) is backwards compatible with ASCII.

## Control Characters (0-31 and 127)

Reserved for non-printing commands like line feed, carriage return, and backspace. These characters control how text is processed rather than representing visible symbols.

## Printable Characters (32-126)

Include letters, numbers, and punctuation marks that appear as visible text. This range contains:

* Numbers (0-9)
* Uppercase letters (A-Z)
* Lowercase letters (a-z)
* Common punctuation marks and symbols
