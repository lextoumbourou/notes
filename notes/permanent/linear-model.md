A **Linear Model** represents the relationship between dependent variables and independent variables, expressed as:

$$
\begin{equation}
    Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \ldots + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon
\end{equation}
$$

Where:

* $Y$ is the [Dependent Variable](Dependent%20Variable).
* $\beta_0$ is the intercept.
* *$\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_n$ are the coefficients.
* $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are the independent variables.
* $\epsilon$ is the error term.

[Linear Regression](linear-regression.md), [Lasso](lasso.md) and [Variable Subset Selection](../../../permanent/variable-subset-selection.md) are examples of coefficient estimation techniques.
