Flow matching learns to transform noise into data by modelling the continuous path between them, rather than the step-by-step denoising process used in traditional [Diffusion Models](diffusion-models.md). Originally described in paper [Flow Matching for Generative Modeling](../../../permanent/flow-matching-for-generative-modeling.md).
