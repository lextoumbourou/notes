    "**TF-IDF** (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) is a word numerisation technique in NLP which weights terms by their importance in the document relative to a corpus. The idea is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Words that appear frequently in a specific document should be weighted higher.\n",
    "2. Words that appear frequently across all documents (like \"the\", \"is\", and \"and\") have less signal and are weighted lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative numerisation approach to the [Bag-of-Words Model](bag-of-words-model.md), which simply counts word frequency in a text - TF-IDF includes context about how important each word is compared to the corpus as a whole.\n",
    "#### Step-by-step\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Term Frequency (TF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures how frequently a term occurs in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{tf}(t, d) = \\frac{\\text{count of \\textit{t} in \\textit{d}}}{\\text{total words in \\textit{d}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{idf}(t) = \\log\\left(\\frac{N}{1 + df_t}\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures how rare a term is across the entire corpus of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $N$: Total number of documents.\n",
    "* $df_t$: Number of documents containing the term.\n",
    "* The `+1` (smoothing) prevents division by zero if a term isn't in the training corpus.\n",
    "* The `log` function dampens the magnitude of the IDF weight, ensuring that extremely rare words don't overpower the entire vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. TF-IDF Score**\n",
    "\n",
    "The final score is the product of these two metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{tf-idf}(t, d) = \\text{tf}(t, d) \\times \\text{idf}(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Words that are frequent in a specific document but rare across the corpus receive the highest scores, making them the \"signature\" terms for that document.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Normalisation**\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF vectors are typically normalised to unit length using L2 (Euclidean) normalisation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{v} = \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|_2} = \\frac{v}{\\sqrt{\\sum_i v_i^2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, longer documents would naturally have higher TF-IDF magnitudes.\n",
