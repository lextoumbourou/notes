Logistic Regression is a [Supervised Learning](supervised-learning.md) algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It models the probablity of beloinging to a class by applying the [Logistic Function](../../../permanent/logistic-function.md) (aka Sigmoid) to a linear combination of input features. In practice, the implementation is [Linear Regression](linear-regression.md) followed by the sigmoid function.
