Some special infinite sets come up all the time in math:

* $\mathbf{Z}$ = set of integers = $\{...,2,−1,0,1,2, ...\}$
* $\mathbb{N}$ = $\mathbf{Z^{+}}$ = set of positive integers = $\{1,2,3,...\}$
* $\mathbf{Z−}$ = set of negative integers = $\{. . . , −3, −2, −1\}$
* $\mathbf{W}$ = set of whole numbers = $\{0,1,2,3,...\}$
* $\mathbf{Q}$ = set of rational numbers = $\{p/q|p, q ∈ \mathbf{Z} ∧ q \neq 0\}$
* $\mathbb{R}$ = set of real numbers
* $\mathbb{R^{+}}$ = set of positive real numbers = $\{x ∈ R|x > 0\}$
* $\mathbb{R}−$ = set of negative real numbers = $\{x ∈ R|x < 0\}$

They can be very useful to memorise.
