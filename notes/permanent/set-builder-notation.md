When a [Set](set.md) has too many elements to list, we can use the **Set-Builder Notation**, which looks like this:

$$
\begin{align}
A = \{X | x \in \text{ days of the weekend }\} \\
= \{ \text{Sunday, Saturday} \}
\end{align}
$$

The $|$ operator here means "such that", i.e., $x$ for all $x$ such that $x$ is a day of the weekend.
