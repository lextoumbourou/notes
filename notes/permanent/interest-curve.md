An Interest Curve refers to the guest's interest over time during an experience (game, book, movie etc). The ideal interest curve usually involves an initial peak followed by a gradual increase (with peaks and valley) that increase until the final climax at the end of the experience. By plotting your experiences' interest curves, you may discover problematic areas of your experience that need to be resolved.

This is related to [Triangularity In Game Design](triangularity-in-game-design.md) in the sense that high-risk, high-reward options add interest to the game. Also, [Game Design is Problem Solving](Game Design is Problem Solving.md) as interest curves are a useful problem solving technique.
