A sequence is a set of numbers written in a specific order.

[Arithmetic Sequence](Arithmetic%20Sequence)

When you calculate a sequence by adding a fixed amount to the previous term, it's called an **arithmetic progression** or **arithmetic sequence**.

The fixed amount added each time is called the When you calculate a sequence by adding a fixed amount to the previous term, it's called an **arithmetic progression** or **arithmetic sequence**.
        * [Common Difference](Common%20Difference)
            * The fixed amount added each time is **common difference**.
        * [First Term](First%20Term)
            * The starting point is called the **first term**.
        * For example, start at 1 and add 6 each time: 1, 7, 13, 19, ...
            * 1 is first term
            * 6 is common difference

 [Geometric Progressions](geometric-progressions.md)

* When you multiply the previous term by a fixed amount.
* The first value of the sequence: **first term**
* The fixed amount to multiply previous term: **common ratio**
* Examples:
    * Find first 6 terms of geometric progression with first term 3 and common ratio 2:
        * $3$, $2 \times 3 = 6$, $2 \times 3 \times 2 = 12, 24, 48, 96$
    * First 5 terms of geometric sequence with first term 5 and common ratio $\frac{2}{3}$
        * $5, 10/3, 20/9, 40/27, 80/81$
    * A geometric progression is given by 1, 1/2, 1/4, ... What is the common ratio?
        * First term is 1. What must you multiple to get 1/2? 1/2
        * Common ratio can always be found by dividing any term by the previous term.
    * First 6 terms of geometric sequence with first term 4 and common ratio -1.
        * 4, -4, 4, -4, 4, -4
        * Because the common ratio is negative, the terms of the sequence alternate in sign.
    * General notation for geometric sequences.
        * First term is $a$ and common ratio is $r$.
        * 2nd term is $a \times r$
        * Third term is $(ar) \times r = ar^2$
        * Fourth is $(ar) \times r \times r = ar^3$
    * A geometric progression can be written as: $a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ...$
        * $a$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio.
    * Therefore, the $nth$ term is of a geometric progression is given by $ar^{n-1}$
    * Example: the 7th of the progression with first term 2 and common ratio 3:
        * $ar^{n-1} = 2 \times 3^{7-1} = 1458$
