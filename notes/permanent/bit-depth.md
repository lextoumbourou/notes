Bit depth in digital audio is the 2nd key factor, next to [Sample Rate](sample-rate.md), that determines the quality of sound in a digital audio recording.

Bit depth refers to the number of bits used to describe the amplitude of these waves at each sample point: the higher the bit depth, the more detailed the amplitude information, resulting in a more dynamic and nuanced sound.

Common Bit Depths:

* 16-bit: Standard for CDs, offers a good dynamic range for most listening environments.
* 24-bit: Often used in professional recording studios, providing a greater dynamic range.
* 32-bit: Mostly used in audio processing and mixing for its high precision and headroom.
