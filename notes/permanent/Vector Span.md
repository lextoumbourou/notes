The span of the vector span refers to any vector you can get by just scaling it. If you draw a line passing passing through the origin that contains the vector, that span of that vector is every vector that fits on the line.

It's all the vector you can make by scaling the vector.

The span of 2 vectors is all the vectors that can be made through linear combinations of the vectors.
