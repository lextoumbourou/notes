**Schema Theorem**, formulated by John Holland in 1975, provides the theoretical foundation for understanding why genetic algorithms work. It mathematically describes how certain patterns (called schemas) in the population propagate through generations.

The Schema Theorem says that short, low-order schemata with above-average fitness increase exponentially in frequency in successive generations.
