In physics, acceleration is a [Vector Quantity](../../../permanent/vector-quantity.md) that represents the rate of change of an object's [Velocity](../../../permanent/velocity.md) over time.

$$
\text{Acceleration} = \frac{\text{Final Velocity - Initial Velocity}}{\text{Time Interval}}
$$

The relationship between force and mass is expressed in [Newton's Second Law of Motion](newtons-second-law.md) which states the acceleration of an object is equal to the sum of forces over the object's mass: $\text{Acceleration} = \text{Force} / \text{Mass}$, which can be rewritten to show how to calculate the force of an object, at a point in time: $\text{Force} = \text{Mass} \times \text{Acceleration}$.
