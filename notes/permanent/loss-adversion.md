Schell describes Kahneman and Tversky's Prospect Theory as applied to games, in that players will be willing to pay a premium to avoid losses - they may take a lower [Expected Value](expected-value.md) option if it means less chance of regret. Even more surprising, players will be willing to take risks to avoid losses. Think of a gambler who lost a little money, they may be willing to gamble more money to avoid a little regret. Further described in Wikipedia article on [Loss adversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion).
