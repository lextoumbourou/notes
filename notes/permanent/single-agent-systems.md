**Single-Agent Systems** in [Agentic Reasoning](agentic-reasoning.md) is a pattern where a single model performs the typical agentic patterns of reflection, planning and tool use.

Single agents systems tend to thrive when there's a well-defined problem or feedback from other agent-personas, or the user is not needed [^1].

Agents are given system prompts and the necessary tools; no other models provide feedback. However, there could be options for humans to guide the output.
