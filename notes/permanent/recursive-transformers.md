**Recursive Transformers** are [Transformer](transformer.md) architecture modification that repeatedly apply the same set of shared layers is applied repeatedly in a recursive fashion. A form of [Weight Sharing](../../../permanent/weight-sharing.md) allow for models that have shallow networks with comparable results to deeper networks with distinct layers.

First described in [Universal Transformers](../../../permanent/universal-transformers.md) paper.
