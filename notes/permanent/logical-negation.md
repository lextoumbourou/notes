The negation of a [Proposition](proposition.md) $p$ is "It is not the case the $p$". Denoted by $\neg p$.

Not $p$

Examples:

Let p: Paris is the capital of France
and q: Apollo is a Hindu god. The negation of p is
∼p: It is not the case that Paris is the capital of France. This sentence, however, is often written as
∼p: Paris is not the capital of France. Likewise, the negation of q is
∼q: Apollo is not a Hindu god.
