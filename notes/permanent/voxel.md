A voxel refers to a single datapoint in a 3d-grid, in the same way a [Pixel](pixel.md) refers to a datapoint on a 2d-grid. The word is a combination of "volume" and "pixel".

The volume of a voxel and the data stored can be anything.

For example, the Terrain system in Roblox allow creators to fill a grid of 3x3x3 voxels with different material each with different occupancy values (ie how full of the material they are).

[This Roblox Script](https://gist.github.com/lextoumbourou/b1b29c27b69caf29cc2f9a2e04949734) creates a single voxel of water with 100% occupancy (used as the cover image).
