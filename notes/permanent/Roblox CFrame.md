In Roblox, a CFrame (coordinate frame) is an object that represents position and rotation in 3D space.

A can create a CFrame with the `new()` constructor.

```lua
local cframe = CFrame.new()
```

`CFrame` is a property of [[Roblox Part]]. You can move a part by assigning a new the CFrame to it:

```lua
local part = Instance.new('Part')
part.CFrame = CFrame.new(0, 10, 0)
```

Note that it's the same thing by assigning a [[Roblox Vector3]] to the `Position` property.

```lua
part.Position = Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
```

However, CFrame can encode a lot more information than a Vector3.

You can also construct a rotated `CFrame` using the Angles constructor. It takes the rotation around each axis in [[Radians]]:

```lua
part.CFrame = CFrame.Angles(0, math.rad(90), 0)
```

That's the same as assigning a rotational Vector3 to the `Orientation` property:

```lua
part.Orientation = Vector3.new(0, 90, 0)
```

Although the `Orientation` property expects rotation in degrees.

You can combine a position CFrame with an `Angles` CFrame by multiplying them together:

```lua
--- Place a part at 0, 10, 0 with Orientation 0, 90, 0.
part.CFrame = CFrame.new(0, 10, 0) * CFrame.Angles(0, math.rad(90), 0)
```

Later in the article, we'll look at what it means to multiply two CFrames.

CFrame has many handy constructor methods.

You can create a CFrame that looks at another part using the `lookAt` constructor:

```lua
local thing = game.Workspace.Thing
local position = Vector3.new(0, 0, 0)

part.CFrame = CFrame.lookAt(position, thing)
```

A CFrame can be used to calculate relative position from CFrame. For example, if I want to put a part in front of a player's face, no matter which direction they're facing (even if they're upside down), we can use the `ToWorldSpace()`:

```lua
local relativePositionOfNewPart = CFrame.new(0, 0, 10)
part.CFrame = character.Head.CFrame:ToWorldSpace(relativePositionOfNewPart)
```

That function is the equivalent of multiplying the left CFrame by the right  `character.Head.CFrame * relativePositionOfNewPart` (note that CFrame multiplication is not communitive - the order matters). 

A CFrame is composed of 4 [[Vector]]s. 

1. <strong>Position vector $(x, y, z)$</strong>
2. <font color="#A92C21">Right vector $(rX, rY, rZ)$</font>
3. <font color="#89CC4C">Up vector $(uX, uY, uZ)$</font>
4. <font color="#1220CB">Look (front) vector $(lX, lY, lZ)$</font>

You can view the raw values using the `Components` method: 

```lua
local x, y, z, rightX, rightY, rightZ, upX, upY, upZ, lookX, lookY, lookZ = cf:Components()
```

We can use the output of this function to serialize CFrames to a Datastore. When creating a furniture placement system, for example.

Under the hood, Roblox multiplies CFrames by structuring into a Matrix like this:

$\begin{bmatrix}\textcolor{BrickRed}{rX} & \textcolor{green}{uX} & \textcolor{blue}{lX} & \textbf{x} \\ \textcolor{BrickRed}{rY} & \textcolor{green}{uY} & \textcolor{blue}{lY} & \textbf{y} \\ \textcolor{BrickRed}{rZ} & \textcolor{green}{uZ} & \textcolor{blue}{lZ} & \textbf{z} \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$

The <font color="#A92C21">right</font>, <font color="#89CC4C">up</font>, and <font color="#1220CB">look</font> vectors are perpendicular vectors that describe the CFrame's rotation.

This example shows a simple matrix multiplication example. Multiplying a 90Â° rotated CFrame with a straight facing vector two up. Note how the result CFrame is two studs higher than the original CFrame. This is the equivalent of using `ToWorldSpace(cframe)`.
