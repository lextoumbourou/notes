A Number Base represents how we represent numbers. The base number determines the number of unique symbols that it uses, and as how values of each digit position are calculated.

Base 10 is the number system that we humans are familiar with it. It's no coincidence that 10 is the number of both our fingers and toes.

We represent each number from right-to-left, as the number of 1s, numbers of 10s and number of 100s.

Start with the number 321.

We describe it as 3 hundred and twenty-one. Or:

3 one-hundreds (300) + 2 tens (20) + one

Another way to write is is as a table:

| 100 | 10  | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  3   |  2   |  1   |

But Base 10 is not the only possible base. There are many.

Computers do not have 10 fingers. Computers are made up of circuits, each circuit has an one/off .

So, they have 2 digits: 0, 1 (on and off).

Numbers can be represented in this base, called Base 2 or Binary. In Binary, each digit position represents a power of 2, rather than a power of 10 as in the Decimal system.

Let's take a look at the Binary representation of the number 13.

In Base 10, the number 13 can be represented as:

1 eight (8) + 1 four (4) + 0 twos (0) + 1 one (1)

In Binary, we write it as 1101.

We can also represent it in a table format similar to the Base 10 example:

8	4	2	1
1	1	0	1
Other number bases exist as well, such as Base 8 (Octal) and Base 16 (Hexadecimal). Each base system has its unique set of symbols and place values based on its base number. For example, the Hexadecimal system has 16 symbols (0-9 and A-F) and uses powers of 16 for its place values.
