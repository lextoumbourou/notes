A **Colour Space** is a specific space where coordinates describe the position of colours based on attributes like [Brightness](brightness.md), [Hue](hue.md) and [Colourfulness](colourfulness.md). A [Colour Model](../../../permanent/colour-model.md) operates within a colour space, although some literature[^1] uses "colour space" as a synonym for "colour model."

The canonical colour space used with [[rgb]] describes colour by the amounts of red, green, and blue "phosphor emission", which is applied to match a colour.

Other colour spaces exist based on different device capabilities, including [Hue Saturation Value (HSV)](colourspace-hsv.md), [CIE Lab](../../../permanent/colourspace-cielab.md), and many more.
