The probability of an event is the number of ways you can achieve that outcome over the number of possible outcomes.

For example, the probability of flipping a coin and seeing heads, we would write as P(H).

Since there are 2 possible outcomes of a coin flip, we would write as:

$P(H) = \frac{1}{2}$

If you add the probabilities of all possible events, the sum should equal 1.

What if we wanted to calculate the probability of
