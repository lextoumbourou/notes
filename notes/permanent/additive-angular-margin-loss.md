A loss function that extends [CosFace](cosface.md) by introducing an additive angular margin loss to maximise the angular distance between different face embeddings.

See [ArcFace: Additive Angular Margin Loss for Deep Face Recognition](../reference/papers/arcface-additive-angular-margin-loss-for-deep-face-recognition.md).
