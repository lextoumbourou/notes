Story-focused standups work like this: every morning, we meet, and the host walks us through each ticket in progress from right to left, with assignees giving a brief update. We take turns hosting the meeting.

We used to do it in front of a physical board, but nowadays, the host shares the board on their screen. 

In contrast, a person-focused standup, also known as Three Questions  [^1], works like this: every morning, we meet, and each person answers three questions: "what did you work on today?", "What did you work on yesterday?" and "Are there any blockers?". Each team picks some method for selecting who speaks next.

Either way, we aim to finish standup in 15 minutes or less. The host politely tries to keep updates brief and organizes follow-up discussions if more time is required.

For these three reasons, I think story-focused daily standups are almost always better, having tried both at times throughout my career.

1. Story-focused reminds us every day of what we're trying to achieve

    The goal of a standup is to review the work in progress. It is a daily reminder of our commitments and our best chance to adjust if it looks like we're heading into danger. If things have to change mid-sprint, it is a chance for everyone to know what's happening.
    
    On the other hand, the goal is not to review the details of each other's work days nor to justify our existence.
    
2. Story-focused standups are collaborative.

    Product development is a team sport. We all have different skills, and collectively, we seek to build something more significant than one of us could alone.
    
    Focusing on each other's updates in our overall plan gives us a better chance of collaboration.
    
    Maybe the Designer learns how difficult a particular detail is to implement and can suggest a simpler alternative. Perhaps another developer knows an expert in an area of struggle from another team who can help. 
    
    In contrast, in a person-focused standup, lacking the context of each other's updates, we may find ourselves tuning out some of the ones that aren't clear to us.

3. Story-focused standups are more fun and less stressful.

    Since we're focusing on what we're collecting and achieving, not the details of each person's work days, we can all be more engaged and present. 
    
    A meeting where everyone is engaged and present is much more fun than we're not.
    
We do standups because the coordination effort is complex enough to require daily alignment. If it isn't sufficiently complex - i.e., if it's a small team - you may not need standup.
