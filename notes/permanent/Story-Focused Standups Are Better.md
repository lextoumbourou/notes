Story-focused daily standups work like this: we work through each ticket in progress from right to left, with each assignee explaining the next steps required to move the story to the left.

In contrast, a person-focused standup will have each person answering three familiar questions: what did you work on today, what did you work on yesterday, and are there any blockers.

I make the case that a story-focused daily standup is almost always a better idea, having tried both at times throughout my career.

1. Story-focused is a daily reminder of what we are trying to achieve.

    We committed to a bunch of work in sprint planning; it seems like a good idea to remind ourselves daily of what that work was.

2. Story-focused standups are more inclusive.

    As developers, we may find ourselves deep in a feature's weeds. When you ask me what I worked on yesterday, it might be: refactored code into a shared module, refactored the database to support a one-to-many relationship between users and profiles, etc.

    A team member lacking all the technical context might soon tune out, feeling that this status update isn't relevant to them. However, if the standup is story-focused, the context should be clear. Having clear context gives us a higher chance of collaboration. Maybe the Product Owner knows that particular feature detail is optional, and learning of the additional difficulties in implementation can make a call to leave it out.

3. Story-focused standups are more collaborative.

    I am not interested in the exact details of everyone's work day. As a leader, that is a form of micromanagement, which is at odds with trust and collaboration. I am interested in how we achieve our overall team objectives.

With every ceremony, we must remind ourselves why we're doing things at regular intervals. For me, the why of the standup is to ensure the whole team remains aligned on the direction and to allow us to constantly shift when we drift in a different direction.

A story-first standup does that; a person-first does not.
