According to Ahrens, who cites Doyle and Zakrajsek, breaks are not only opportunities for the brain to recover, they are essential for learning. They give the brain an opportunity to move information into long term storage and prepare for new information.

Talking a walk, shower or nap supports learning and thinking.
