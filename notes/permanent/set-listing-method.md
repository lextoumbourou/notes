## Listing Method

If we want to denote a set, we list the members of the set in between curly brackets.

For example, the set of days in the week is:

$\text{Set of days in the week} = \{\text{Sunday}, \text{Monday}, \text{Tuesday}, \text{Wednesday}, \text{Thursday}, \text{Friday}, \text{Saturday}\}$

Whereas the set $B$ of days on the weekend is:

$\text{Set of days in the weekend} = \{\text{Sunday}, \text{Saturday}\}$

The set $P$ of positive integers < 10:

$P = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$

We call this method of notation the **Listing Method**.
