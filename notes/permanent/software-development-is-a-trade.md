summary: we should educate developers accordingly

Despite their occasional ridicule within the industry, the software boot camp model works - the top boot camps tend to have a higher success rate at landing people in jobs than computer science departments at top universities [^1] [^2].

Anecdotally, I've hired many devs who came straight out of boot camps, and they all rocked and are in the industry to this day - most of them have become seniors.

From day 1, they came to work knowing Git, how to use their IDE (shortcuts, etc.), the basics of typical Agile-like practices and had practical experience building web applications.

Yes, a [Survivorship Bias](survivorship-bias.md) is at play here - not everyone "made it". However, their fellow students who found that software wasn't for them only took 3-6 months of their lives learning it instead of 3-10 years to get a degree.

On the flip side, for a typical Computer Science degree, the engineering content is often unaligned with the expectations of a junior developer [^3]. In the field, you're going to spend a lot less time concerned with the complexity of search algorithms or building abstract syntax trees, and a lot more time creating CI pipelines, dealing with merge conflicts, and investigating complex customer issues, which, in my experience, are usually a tiny part of one engineering module, if covered at all, in a CompSci degree.

The fundamentals are useful and typically must be in place to progress into senior roles, and they can't be taught in depth at a short boot camp. However, I argue that **fundamentals are much more efficiently learned alongside a career as a practising software engineer**. Instead of learning them all up front, they'd be much more effectively taught after an engineer has some practice building products with software. For example, learning about worst-case complexity and Big O notation is much easier when you have already blown up prod, thanks to a nested loop in your code.

And that's much closer to how an apprenticeship works: some study, followed by lots of hands-on experience, followed by more study, and so on until you're a professional.

**Like a trade, writing software can only be mastered by practising it - a lot, and we should educate developers accordingly.**
