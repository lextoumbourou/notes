Software is a trade, and we should educate developers accordingly.

Despite their occasional ridicule within the industry, the Software Bootcamp model works - the top boot camps have a higher success rate at landing people in jobs at ~80% than computer science departments at top universities, at ~61% or less. [1]

Anecdotally, I've hired many devs that came straight out of boot camps (specifically Coder Academy Brisbane), and they all rocked and are in the industry to this day - most of them have become seniors.

From day 1, they came to work knowing Git, how to use their IDE (shortcuts), the basics of typical Agile-like practices and had practical experience building web applications.

Yes, a survivorship bias is at play here - not everyone "made it". However, the other fellow students who found the software wasn't for them only took 3-6 months of their lives learning this instead of 3-10 years getting a degree.

On the flip side, I'm nearly two years into a part-time Computer Science degree, and the engineering content is about 5-10 years behind what the industry is doing. I haven't seen version control mentioned in a lecture once.

That's not to say that the fundamentals aren't important or useful - they must be learned to progress into senior roles, and they typically can't be taught in depth at a short boot camp.

However, I argue that **fundamentals are much more efficiently learned alongside a career as a practising software engineer**. Learning about worst-case complexity and Big O notation is much easier when you have already blown up prod, thanks to a nested loop in your code, for example.

That's much closer to how an apprenticeship works: some study, followed by lots of hands-on experience, followed by more study, and so on until you're a professional. Like a trade, writing software can only be mastered by practising it - a lot, and we should educate developers accordingly.

The data is from 2021, so it's probably in need of updating in 2022-2023 conditions. My opinion about software engineering as a trade is agnostic to the success of boot camps anyway.
