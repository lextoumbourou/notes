Schell says that *"the power of variable rewards over fixed ones has been proven in thousands of psychological experiences"* (though no experiments were referenced). The idea that it is more interesting for a player to be occasionally given a reward than always given a reward. For example, when you capture a Pokemon, you are sometimes given extra items and even more rarely they change into another Pokemon after catching them. The surprise stays with you a longer time, even if the frequency of rewards is the same.

Related to the idea of [Triangularity In Game Design](triangularity-in-game-design.md) and the taking risks component of David Perry's [Key to Addictive Game Design](Key to Addictive Game Design.md).
