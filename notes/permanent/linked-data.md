**Linked Data** is a structure for data that allows for linking between data. It was coined in 2006, in a design note about the [Semantic Web](semantic-web.md) project. The idea was to build on existing web technologies like [HTTP](../../../permanent/http.md), [RDF](rdf.md) and [URI](../../../permanent/uri.md)s, but extend to make them Machine Readable.

[Wikidata](../../../permanent/Wikidata.md) is a key example of a Linked Data implementation.
