A **language model** estimates the probabilities of token sequences from a training corpus. In practice, this can be used to predict the next word given a sequence of text - or any discrete sequence of information, to generate entirely new, plausible sequences.

Nowadays, it is mostly discussed in the context of [Large Language Models](large-language-models.md).
