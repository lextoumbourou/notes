A **world model** in AI refers to a system's internal representation of the environment, which helps it understand and predict outcomes of actions. It enables AI to simulate scenarios, learn from them, and make decisions based on predicted future states of the environment.

For example, the world model in the paper [Diffusion for World Modeling: Visual Details Matter in Atari](../reference/papers/diffusion-for-world-modeling-visual-details-matter-in-atari.md), used [Diffusion Models](diffusion-models.md) to generate world models of games in Atari 100k and CS:Go.
