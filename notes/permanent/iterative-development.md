Iterative development is the centrepiece of the [Principles of Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html):

> Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for a shorter timescale.

It is the antithesis of the hypothetic "Waterfall" methodology, which aims to deliver a project in a cascading, finite work stream, with results delivered at the end.

In the book The Art of Game Design, the importance of iterative development is summarised in this quote from [Rule of Loop](rule-of-loop.md):

> "The more times you test and improve your design, the better your game will be."
