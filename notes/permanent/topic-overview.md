In Zettelkasten, the topic overview is a note that links to key [Permanent Notes](permanent-notes.md)ithin a topic. It is linked to via the index and serves as an entry point for a topic.

It is added when you have accumulated a large enough collections of topic notes that it becomes necessary.

It's also the inbetween point between individual notes and a manuscript, allowing for ordering and extra annotation.

The topic overview is expected to change over time, as you develop a richer understandings. It also shows the growth of a topic.

Luhmann collected up to 25 notes on a single topic.

An example of how Zettlekasten has [Emergent Complexity](Emergent Complexity.md). In that, it's a simple methodology that can lead to rich and complex topics.
