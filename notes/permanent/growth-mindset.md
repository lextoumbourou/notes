According to Carol Dweck, people are on a continuum between two ideas about acquiring skills: those with Fixed Mindset believe that all ability is fixed at birth and those with Growth Mindsets believe that they can master any skill.

People closer to the growth mindset spectrum see adversity and challenge as a chance to grow.

Dweck claims that a reliable predictor for long-term success is having a “growth mindset.”

She also claims that who're frequently praised for their natural talents develop a fixed mindset. Being praised for who you are instead of what you do can lead to a fear of failure and an avoidance of trying new things.
