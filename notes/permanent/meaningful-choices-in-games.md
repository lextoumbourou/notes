Schell talks about the importance of meaningful choices in games: for example, if you can choose between 10 cars in a racing game, but they all handle the same, it's like having no choice at all. On the flipside, if you have 10 choices but one that's clearly better than the others, it's also like having no choice at all. The latter scenario is also known as a dominant strategy.
