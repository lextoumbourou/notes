**Agents**, in [Agentic Reasoning](agentic-reasoning.md), are entities powered by [Large Language Models](large-language-models.md)s that can plan and take actions to execute goals.

They can be part of a [Single-Agent Systems](single-agent-systems.md), or [Multi-Agent Systems](multi-agent-systems.md) where multiple agents work together to achieve a goal.

Commonly, each agent is given a [Persona](../../../permanent/persona-prompt-engineering.md), as well as access to tools (see [Tool Use](tool-use.md)).

Some agents also contain a [Memory](memory.md) component, where they can save and load information outside of their messages and prompts.
