Fleeting notes in Zettelkasten are for capturing ideas while reading, listening, or thinking. They are designed to be short-lived and should be stored in an inbox for processing into [Literature Notes](Literature Notes.md), ideally within 1 to 2 days. They can be highlights, notes within a page, or notes on paper.

The standard note-taking approach where we collect chronologically ordered notes, for example, in a scientific journal, presents us with 2 problems:

1. all notes are treated as [Permanent Notes](Permanent Notes.md). This means really good ideas can be "diluted" amongst all ideas
2. the ordering makes searching, combining, and rearranging old ideas difficult.

Also, without a system for processing fleeting notes, they can quickly accumulate to the point where the benefit of taking notes diminishes with every new entry, leading to a desire to "start from scratch".

The system of converting Fleeting Notes into [Literature Notes](Literature Notes.md) then into [Permanent Notes](Permanent Notes.md) is a loop that gives us opportunities to absorb, filter and elaborate on ideas. In that way, it shares goals with the [Rule of Loop](rule-of-loop.md) in Game Design.
