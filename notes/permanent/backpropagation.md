**Backpropagation** is an algorithm used to train neural networks, where it calculates the gradient of a loss function concerning each weight by propagating the error backward from output layer to input layer. The process enables the network to minimise error and improve predictive accuracy over time.

First described in [Learning Representations by Back-propagating Errors](../../../reference/learning-representations-by-back-propagating-errors.md).
