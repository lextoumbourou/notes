**Diffusion Models** also known as **Diffusion Probabilitistic Models** are a type of generaive model that learn to generate data by reversing a gradual, noise-driven diffusion process.

First introduced in [Deep Unsupervised Learning Using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics](../../../reference/deep-unsupervised-learning-using-nonequilibrium-thermodynamics.md), in which they describe the key steps involved in training diffusion models:

Forward Diffusion: Add noise to data over multiple steps.
Reverse Diffusion: Learn to reverse the process. Go from noise to data.
