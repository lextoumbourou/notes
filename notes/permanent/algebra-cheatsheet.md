## Cross Multiply

If you have a fraction on both sides of an expression, cross-multiplication can be used to eliminate the fractions:

$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$
$ad = bc$

Now we can solve for any of the variables, for example:

$a = \frac{bc}{d}$

## Simplify Square Root of Fractions

$\sqrt{\frac{1}{200}}$

Same thing as the square root of numerator and denom.

$\frac{\sqrt{1}}{\sqrt{200}}$

Square root of 1 is just 1.

$\frac{1}{\sqrt{200}}$

Square root of 200, is the same thing as $\sqrt{2 \times 100}$ Is the same thing as: $\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{100} = 10\sqrt{2}$

## Quadratic formula

## Solve Cubic Equation

Standard form: $Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D = 0$

Solve: $2x^3 + x^2 - 13x + 6 = 0$

Step 1. Check if x = 1 is the solution.

RULE: If A + B + C + D = 0, then solution is always x = 1.

A = 2, B = 1, C = -13, D = 6

2 + 1 + -13 + 6 = -4 (not 0).

Step 2. check if -1 is the solution

Rule: add coefficients of alternative terms. If sums are the same, then x = -1

2 + 13 = 15, 1 + 6 = 7

Step 3. find the divisors of the Q and P

$Q = 2$, $P = 6$

P = 1, 2, 3, 6
Q = 1, 2

Find: 1/1 2/1, 3/1, 6/1, 1/2, 3/2

Test each of these, excluding the results we already know. 2, 3, 6, 1/2, 3/2
