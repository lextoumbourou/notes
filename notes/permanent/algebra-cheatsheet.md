## Cross Multiply

If you have a fraction on both sides of an expression, cross-multiplication can be used to eliminate the fractions:

$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$
$ad = bc$

Now we can solve for any of the variables, for example:

$a = \frac{bc}{d}$

## Simplify Square Root of Fractions

$\sqrt{\frac{1}{200}}$

Same thing as the square root of numerator and denom.

$\frac{\sqrt{1}}{\sqrt{200}}$

Square root of 1 is just 1.

$\frac{1}{\sqrt{200}}$

Square root of 200, is the same thing as $\sqrt{2 \times 100}$ Is the same thing as: $\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{100} = 10\sqrt{2}$
