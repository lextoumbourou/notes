Another way to combine two [Propositions](proposition.md) using the connective "or".

The proposition $p$ or $q$ is true if $p$ or $q$ is true.

p: Harry likes pepporoni pizza for lunch

q: Harry likes mushroom pizza for lunch

Their disjunction is given by:

$p \lor q$: Harry likes pepperoni pizza for lunch or Harry likes mushroom pizza for lunch.

This sentence, however, is often written as:

$p \lor q$: Harry likes pepperoni or mushroom pizza for lunch.

Note that either could be try and the disjunction would still be true. It's not an exclusive or.

| $p$   | $q$   | $p \lor q$ |
