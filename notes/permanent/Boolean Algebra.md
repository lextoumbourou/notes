Based on 3 fundamental operations:
  * AND
      * logical product, intersection or conjunction
      * represented as x . y, $x \cap y$ or $x \wedge y$.
  * OR
      * logical sum, union or disjunction
      * represented as $x + y$, $x \cup y$, $x \lor y$
  * NOT
      * logical complement or negation
      * represented as $x'$, $\overline{x}$ or $\neg x$
* When parentheses are not used, orperators have order of prefs: NOT > AND > OR.
