Nielson's 10 Usability Principles are user experience principles focused on making intuitive, efficient and user-friendly experiences.

* **Visibility of System Status**: Keep users informed with timely feedback.
* **Match between System and Real World**: Use familiar language and real-world conventions.
* **User Control and Freedom**: Offer an easy way to undo actions.
* **Consistency and Standards**: Maintain uniformity in words and actions across the platform.
* **Error Prevention**: Design to eliminate or check for errors before they occur.
* **Recognition Rather Than Recall**: Make information visible or easily accessible.
* **Flexibility and Efficiency**: Provide shortcuts for experienced users and customization for frequent actions.
* **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**: Keep irrelevant information to a minimum.
* **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors**: Use plain language for error messages and offer solutions.
* **Help and Documentation**: Ideally, the system should be intuitive; provide help documentation where necessary
