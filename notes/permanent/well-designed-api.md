According to Khorikov, a well-designed API (application programming interface), is one in which [Observabled Behaviours](Observabled Behaviours) are entirely in the [Public API](Public API), and implementation details are part of the [Private API](Private API).

The simplest way to tell if a class leaks a implementation detail into observable behaviour is if number of operations client needs to perform to achieve a goal is > 1.

Good [Encapsulation](encapsulation.md) protects against [Invariant](Invariant) violations, especially as the complexity of the code base increases.
