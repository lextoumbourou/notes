A machine that can express how computations are performed with limited memory space. They read inputs from a string of symbols and transition to different states based on results.

There are two types of finite automate:

* [Deterministric Finite Automaton](../../../permanent/deterministric-finite-automaton.md) where one state has exactly one transition for each possible input.
* [Nondeterministric Finite Automaton](../../../permanent/nondeterministric-finite-automaton.md) where there can be several possible transitions for a given state and input.
