**Binary Exponential Backoff** is a collision avoidance algorithm used in Wi-Fi networks to manage multiple devices trying to access the same communication channel. After a collision occurs, devices wait for a random backoff time, which doubles with each successive collision, reducing the likelihood of further conflicts.
