The magnitude of a [Vector](vector.md) represents its length or size in the vector space. It is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. This formula comes from the Pythagorean theorem and applies in any dimensional space.

For example, for a vector $\text{vec}{(v)} = (x, y, z)$ in three-dimensional space, the magnitude is computed as:

$||\vec{v}|| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$
