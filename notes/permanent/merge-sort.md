**Merge Sort** is a [Divide-and-Conquer](divide-and-conquer.md) sorting algorithm, which sorts a list recursively by dividing it into halves until a single --element or empty list is created; it then merges these sublists of create a software list.

Merge Sort is one of the faster and most stable sorting algorithms, with an $O(n \log n)$ time complexity in the average and worst case.
