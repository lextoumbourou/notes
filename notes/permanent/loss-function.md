**Loss function** is a mathematical function that evaluates how well a machine learning model's predictions match actual outcomes.

I've written about a few different loss functions, that come up a lot in Machine Learning: 

* [Mean Absolute Error](mean-absolute-error.md) - one of the most basic loss functions. If you have a problem where you're trying to predict something continuous like the height of a person, the mean absolute error is simple the absolute different between your prediction and th action: `abs(prediction - actual)`.
* [Root Mean-Squared Error](root-mean-squared-error.md)
* [Binary Cross-Entropy Loss](binary-cross-entropy-loss.md)
* [Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss](categorical-cross-entropy-loss.md)
