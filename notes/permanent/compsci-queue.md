A queue is a fudemental data structure in Computer Science.

Fundamental concept: a resource that cannot be immediately accessed, so a wait is required.
    * First in, first out or FIFO
        * The longer the wait the sooner the resource will be available.
    * Queue is sequential.
    * Can add an element to the tail.
    * Can remove an element from the head.
    * Contrast with a vector where you can access any element.
    * Operations:
        * head
        * dequeue
        * enqueue
        * empty
        * construct new
