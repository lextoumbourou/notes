The **Encoder-Decoder** pattern in sequence-to-sequence neural network architectures, where an encoder processes the input data into a lower-dimensional representation, called hidden state. This hidden state is then passed to the decoder, which reconstructs or generates the output sequence, aiming to closely match the original data or translate it into a different format.
