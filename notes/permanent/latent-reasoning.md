**Latent Reasoning** is an LLM reasoning paradigm where the model performs computations within its internal hidden space. As opposed to reasoning at the token level in [Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](chain-of-thought-reasoning.md).

It's worth mentioning that the major distinguishing factor between the [total doom scenario](https://ai-2027.com/race) and [not](https://ai-2027.com/slowdown) within [AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/) is distinguished by our ability to interpret the reasoning of AI models, so I guess as with everything in AI in 2025, we'll keep exploring this paradigm at our own risk.
