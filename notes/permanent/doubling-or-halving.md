A [game balancing](game balancing) trick that Schell attributes to design Brian Reynolds (who in term attributes to Sid Meier): when tuning values to balance a game, don't start out by adjusting them by a small amount, but either double or halve them in the direction you think they need to go. It gives you a much clearly picture of the value you are changing and prevents you getting stuck "in the weeds" wondering if the value had an effect.

Since it a technique for problem solving game balance issues, it's related to [Game Design is Problem Solving](game-design-is-problem-solving.md).
