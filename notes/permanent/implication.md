If two propositions $p$ and $q$ can be combined into statements of form: If p, then q, the statement is considered an implication.

Denoted by $p \rightarrow q$

Latex: $p \rightarrow q$

Let
$p$: it will rain tomorrow.
$q$: i will get wet if I go outside

If it will rain tomorrow, I will get wet if I go outside.

Since the statement contains a condition, it is called a conditional statement.

The component $p$ is the **hypothesis** (or **premise**) of the implication, and q is the **conclusion**.

Implications occur in a number of ways:

If p, then q
If p, q
p implies q
p only if q
q if p
p is sufficient for q
q is necessary for p

Note: only $p$ only if $q$ does not have the same mean ing as "p if q". "p if q" has the same meaning as "If q, then p"

### Converse, contrapositive and inverse

Let $p$ and $q$ be propositions and $A$ the conditional statement $p \rightarrow q$

The proposition $q \rightarrow p$ is the **converse** of A

The proposition $\neg q \rightarrow \neg p$ is the **contrapositive** of A.

The proposition $\neg p \rightarrow \neg q$ is the **inverse** of A
