**Unsupervised Learning** is a type of machine learning where models learn patterns and structures from data without the need for labeled responses. Unlike Supervised Learning, which relies on input-output pairs for training, unsupervised learning works with data that lacks specific labels or outcomes. The goal is to uncover the hidden structure or distribution within the data.

Examples:
* [Clustering](clustering.md) - groups similar data points into clusters, where items within a cluster share more similarity with each other than with those in other clusters.
* [Dimensionality Reduction](../../../permanent/dimensionality-reduction.md) - to reduce the number of variables under consideration, simplifying the data while retaining essential information.
* [Anomaly Detection](anomaly-detection.md) - focuses on identifying unusual data points that deviate significantly from the norm
* [Self-Supervised Learning](self-supervised-learning.md) - modifying the data in someway to create labels.
