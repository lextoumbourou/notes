**Supervised Learning** is one of the most common categories of Machine Learning approaches, where a model learns to make inferences about new data by being trained on a corpus of related data. In real-world terms, it's about data that has annotated labels, vs [Unsupervised Learning](unsupervised-learning.md) which does not.
