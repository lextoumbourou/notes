A **neural network** is an Machine Learning Architecture (very) loosely inspired by biological neural systems. In practice, it's an extension of a simpler model like [Linear Regression](linear-regression.md) which adds multiple layers of transformation which include non-linearity (these are usually just simple transformation function), which enables them to learn complex, non-linear relationships in the data.
