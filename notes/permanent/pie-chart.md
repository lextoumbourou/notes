A Pie Chart is a circular [Data Visualisation](../../../permanent/data-visualisation.md) used to display proportional or percentage data, where each "slice" of the pie represents a category's share of the whole. This chart type is particularly effective for showing the composition of a dataset, allowing viewers to quickly grasp the relative sizes of different components and their relationship to the total.
