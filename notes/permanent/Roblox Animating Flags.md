The flag used in Splash is setup with a base part, then a another part which represents the flag tip. Then, a beam is used which connects both parts.

The first part is a script which rotates the first part left to right.

That makes total sense.

The next part is where i'm really lost.

There's another script which runs and sets the BodyPosition to the position of the first part, then rotates it by 5 stus on the X angle.
