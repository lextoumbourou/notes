If a property is valid for $n=0$, and if, assuming it is valid for $n$, it remains valid also for $n + 1$, then the property is valid for any $n$.

Confusingly, **Mathematical Induction** is not the same as [Induction](induction.md) in logical reasoning, and is actually a form of [Deduction](deduction.md).
