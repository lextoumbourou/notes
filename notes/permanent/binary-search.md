Binary search is a search algorithm that requires a sorted array as input. It starts in the midpoint and searches either side of the array, based on whether the midpoint is larger or smaller than the search input. Binary search has $O(log \ n)$ [Worst-Case Time Complexity](worst-case-time-complexity.md).
