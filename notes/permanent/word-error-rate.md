**Word Error Rate** or **WER** is a common metric used in automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks.

Calculated by dividing the total number of errors (substitutions, deletions and insertions) by the total words in the reference transcription and expressing the result as a percentage.

Lower WER is better performance.
