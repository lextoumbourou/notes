**Chain-of-Thought Prompting** is a [Few-Shot Prompting](../../../permanent/few-shot-prompting.md) technique where model is given examples of step-by-step reasoning rather than standard question and answer examples, encouraging the model to think through a problem before returning an answer.

Part of the [Planning](planning.md) category of [Agentic Reasoning](agentic-reasoning.md) design patterns.

Described in paper [Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models](../../../reference/chain-of-thought-prompting-elicits-reasoning-in-large-language-models.md).
