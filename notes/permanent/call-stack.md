The **call stack** is a [Stack](stack.md) used by programming languages to keep track of functions running within a program. When a function is called, its variables and arguments are stored on the stack in an encapsulation called a [Stack Frame](stack-frame.md). The call stack is a finite block of memory, when we run out of stack memory, the program will terminate with a [Stack Overflow](stack-overflow.md).
