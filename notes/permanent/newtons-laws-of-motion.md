In 1686, Newton presented his 3 laws of motion in "Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis". They are:

## [Newton's First Law](newtons-first-law.md)

An object remains at rest or in motion a constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force. In other words, an object will move at a constant speed unless a force is applied to it pushing it in another direction (gravity is one example of a force).

## [Newton's Second Law of Motion](newtons-second-law.md)

2nd law: the [Acceleration](acceleration.md) of an object is equal to the sum of forces / the object's mass (`acceleration = sum of forces / object's mass`). Sometimes expressed as `sum of forces = mass * acceleration` , however, the former is preferred as it shows the positive relationship between acceleration and the force and the negative relationship between its mass.

## [[Newton's Third Law]]

If an object A exerts force on another object B, an equal force will be applied to object A. This can be seen when a swimmer pushed against a wall to propel themselves in the opposite direction across a pool.
