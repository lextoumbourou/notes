An integer is a 32-bit (4-byte) encoding of a number.

It can be signed - which means one bit keeps track of whether it's negative or positive (the "sign") - or unsigned.

A signed integer's range is -2147483648 to 2147483648. Unsigned is 0 to 4294967295.

[Two's compliment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) is used to represent negative numbers in binary.
