Recently I discovered my passion for writing raps. I had always seen myself as more of the producer, but I found-myself with some work related rap writing tasks while at Splash (my previous company), and developed a bit of a penchant for it.

I've also seeing the releasing of the songs as an opportunity to experiment with the current generation of AI video tools. I always dreamed of making music videos for my music, but I'm not really an IRL type of person, and my capacity for genearting art has alawys been a bit limited.

The raps for my alias **Uncle Lex** are mostly about trying to push as many rhyming syllables about a single concept, kinda MF Doom-esque, and with modern trap beats, a genre of beats I've always loved. The latest song is a goofy song, from my dogs persecptive, over a hard-Detroit beat I found on YouTube.

I paid about $100 for the beat, from a great producer DaveGotBeats. I bought a new Shure microphone, which my wife lovingly bought me.

Things left to cover:

Recording it in Logic.
Getting it mixed.

Now I've got a pretty dope song, if I say so myself, even though there's a part at the end that's missing something.
