The **Damerau-Levenshtein** distance is an algorithm that measures the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, substitutions, and transpositions) needed to transform one string into another. It extends the basic [[Levenshtein Distance]] by also allowing transpositions of adjacent characters, making it useful for detecting common typographical errors.
