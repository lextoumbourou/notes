**DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)** is the international standard for storing, transmitting, and sharing medical images such as CT scans, MRIs, and [Mammography](mammography.md) X-rays. It bundles pixel data with patient and study metadata in a single file and enables interoperability across different imaging devices and healthcare systems.
