**Listen-Before-Talk** or **LBT** is a wi-fi channel connection mechanism that ensures a device checks the wireless channel for activity before transmitting data. If the channel is clear, the device proceeds with transmission; if it's busy, the device waits, reducing collisions and interference in shared wireless networks.
