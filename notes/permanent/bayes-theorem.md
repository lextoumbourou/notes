# Bayes Theorem

1% of population has X disease.

A screen test accurately detects the disease for 90% of people with it.

The test also indicates the disease for 15% of people without it.

Suppose a person is screened for the disease tests positive. What is the probability they have it?

D = has disease
T = tests positive

P(D) = 0.01
P(T/D) = .9
P(T/!D) = .15

If it's positive, what's the probably that a person has the disease.

P(D/T) = ?
