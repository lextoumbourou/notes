The **Church-Turing** thesis posits that any computation that a human can perform following a clear set of instructions can also be accomplished by a [Turing Machine](turing-machine.md) - or any reasonable computational model. The thesis, not formally provable, forms the foundational basis for theoretical computer science, implying that the computational power of conventional computers is fundamentally equivalent.
