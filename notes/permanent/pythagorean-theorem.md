**Pythagorean Theorem** describes the relationship between the three sides of a right-angled triangle. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (known as the catheti).

Mathematically, the Pythagorean theorem can be expressed as:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

where $c$ represents the length of the hypotenuse, and $a$ and $b$ represent the lengths of the other two sides.
