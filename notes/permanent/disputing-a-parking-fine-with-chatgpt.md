Recently, on holidays in Far North Queensland, my wife and I parked our rental car in a paid parking lot to visit a restaurant.

I paid using the EasyPark App per the council's instruction on various signs throughout the lot.

When we returned, they had slapped a fine on our Toyota anyway.

I double-checked what I had entered into the app. I mistyped the number plate by one letter. Oops.

Since we have never received a parking fine before, and I had proof of payment, I knew there was a good chance the council would let me off if I sent a letter of explanation.

We had already been experimenting with ChatGPT, and the letter seemed a good test case.

The first response was close but longer than I would like. Plus, I didn't tell it that I was planning to attach a photo of the fine and proof of payment.

That works. Now for a title.

I emailed that<small>*</small> from my phone and a day later received this response.

So you can dispute a parking fine with ChatGPT.

ChatGPT is incredible - I cannot believe how well this technology works. It's like having a talented personal assistant (who is often wrong - need to read their work thoroughly) at your fingertips.

* I used ChatGPT from my phone and didn't screenshot the prompt, so I had to generate a new prompt/response for this blog post. It's similar enough that I'm sure it would work too.
