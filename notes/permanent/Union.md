A merge operation between between 2 [Set](set.md)s.

Represented by the $\cup$ symbol (`\cup` in [LaTeX](LaTeX.md)).

Example (using [Listing Method](set-listing-method.md):

$A = \{a, b, c\}$
$B = \{c, d, e\}$
$A \cup B = \{a, b, c, d, e\}$

* It's a [Commutative Operation](Commutative Operation): $A \cup B = B \cup A$
* It's an [Associativity Operation](Associativity Operation): $A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C$
* Identity Properties: $A \cup \emptyset = A$
* Complement Properties: $A \cup A'$
