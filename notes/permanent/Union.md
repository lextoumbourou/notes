A merge operation between between 2 [[Set]]s.

Represented by the $\cup$ symbol (`\cup` in [[LaTeX]]).

Example (using [[Listing Method]]):

$A = \{a, b, c\}$
$B = \{c, d, e\}$
$A \cup B = \{a, b, c, d, e\}$

* It's a [[Commutative Operation]]: $A \cup B = B \cup A$
* It's an [[Associativity Operation]]: $A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C$
* Identity Properties: $A \cup \emptyset = A$
* Complement Properties: $A \cup A'$
