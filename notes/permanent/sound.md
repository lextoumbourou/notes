Sound is energy produced by vibrating matter. When something vibrates, it creates waves that travel through air, water, or solid materials - but sound cannot travel in a vacuum.

Sound travels in waves, called [Sound Waves](sound-wave.md). Unlike [Electromagnetic energy](../../../permanent/electromagnetic-energy.md), sound requires a medium to propagate.

Your ear receives these sound waves through the ear canal, causing your eardrum to vibrate. These vibrations become nerve signals that your brain interprets as sound. A microphone works similarly, detecting sound waves and converting them to electrical signals.
