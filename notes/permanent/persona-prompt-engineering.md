A **Persona** in the context of [Prompt Engineering](../../../permanent/prompt-engineering.md) refers to shaping the model's response style and the scope of information it uses.

For example, a [System Prompt](../../../permanent/system-prompt.md) that helps answer history-related questions might start with:

> "You are an expert historian called HistoryGPT, specialising in ancient civilisations, with a formal and analytical tone. When responding, provide in-depth historical context, cite key events and figures, and avoid speculation. Your goal is to educate and provide comprehensive insights."

It is sometimes referred to as a [Role (Prompt Engineering)](../../../permanent/role-prompt-engineering.md), although role implies more of a focus on the function or task rather than the tone, voice and style.
