Mean Absolute Difference (MAE) is a function for assessing [Regression](Regression) predictions. It's also as L1 Loss because it takes the [L1 Norm](L1 Norm) of the error vector.

### Steps

1. Calculate error vector as **labels** - **predictions**
2. Take the absolute values of the errors
3. Take the mean of all values.

An alternative to [Root mean-squared error - L2 Loss](root-mean-squared-error-L2-loss.md).
