A system that deals with [Proposition](proposition.md) (statements).

## Proposition

A declarative sentence that is either true or false (but not both) is a proposition.

Also known as a statement.

These sentences would be considered propositions:

* It is Thursday today (true).
* I am 14 years old (false).
* 1 + 1 = 3 (false).

Usually denoted using lowercase letters $p$, $q$, $r$, $s$ or $t$.

p = It rained yesterday.
q = I am happy.

The truthfulness or falsity of a proposition is called its [Truth Value](Truth%20Value). Denoted by $T$ or $F$, or 1 and 0 in computer science.

We can use connectives to change or combine the meaning of propositions.

## Connectives

### [Logical NOT](../journal/permanent/logical-not.md)

Symbol: $\neg p$

An operator that negates a proposition.

* $p$ = I will pass my exam.
* $\neg \ p$ = I will NOT pass my exam.

## [Logical OR](../journal/permanent/Logical%20OR.md)

Symbol: $p \lor q$

True when p OR q is true.

Also known as [Disjunction](disjunction.md).

## [Logical AND](../journal/permanent/Logical%20AND.md)

Symbol: $p \land q$

True only when p AND q is true.

Also called [Conjunction](conjunction.md).

## [Logical IF...THEN](../journal/permanent/logical-if-then)

Symbol: $p \rightarrow q$

If p is true, then q is true.

Also called [implication](implication.md).

## [Logical IF and only IF](logical-if-and-only-if.md): $\leftrightarrow$

Symbol: $p \leftrightarrow q$

Also called [implication](implication.md).

## [Exclusive-Or](exclusive-or.md)

Symbol: $p \oplus q$

p or q but not both.

Also called XOR.
