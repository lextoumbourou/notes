Notes from Khan Academy video [Basic geometry: language and labels | Introduction to Euclidean geometry | Geometry | Khan Academy](https://youtu.be/il0EJrY64qE)

* Word geometry is made up of 2 components: "geo" and "metry":
    * "Geo" - earth
    * "metry" - measurement
    * Therefore, geometery is about how shapes and space (things we see) related to each other.

## Plane

* A [Plane](../../permanent/geometry-plane.md) is a flat surface that has 2 dimensions: width and height and goes on infinity in either direction.

## Point

* A [Point](../../permanent/geometry-point.md) refers to a dot on that plane and is the most basic geometric idea.

    * Points are commonly labelled using upper case letters: A, B, C, D etc
    * Point is said to be 0-dimension: it doesn't provide any direction information.

## Line Segment

* A line that connects 2 points, is referred to as a [Line Segment](../../permanent/geometry-line-segment.md)

    ![line segment examples](/_media/bg-line-segment.png)

    * A line segment is described using its endpoints: the points that it is connected by.
    * In math notation, a line is drawn over the endpoints to denote that it's a line segment.

        $$\overline{AB}$$

    * The endpoints of a line segment can be inversed:

        $$\overline{AB} = \overline{BA}$$

    * Is one-dimension - you can move back and forth along it.

## Ray

* A line that starts from one point that continues on infinitely in one direction is called a [Ray](../../permanent/ray.md)

    ![ray example](/_media/bg-ray.png)

    * The order of a ray is meaninful, unlike a line segment, as it describes the direction of the ray:

        $$\overrightarrow{AB} \neq \overrightarrow{BA}$$

     * The starting point is referred to the endpoint.

## Line

 * A line that continues infinitely in either direction is formally called a [Line](../../permanent/line.md).

     ![line example](/_media/bg-line.png)

     * A line is described by the endpoints it intersects, typically in alphabetical order though the order does not matter.

        $\overleftrightarrow{AB} = \overleftrightarrow{BA}$

## Collinear points

* If you have a line segment and introduce a point in the middle, you could describe all 3 points as "[Colinear](../../permanent/geometry-colinear.md)" - they sit on the same line.

* In the above picture, if the distance between $XZ$ was the same as the distance between $ZX$, then you would refer to Z as the midpoint of the line segment $XY$.
