### Week 2

#### Module 1

##### 1.1

* Understand methods of estimating a company's value
  * Market cap
  * Future dividends
  * Book value
* Company that can produce $1 per year example (similar to Magic Formula lesson of the bubble gum kid)
  * What is the Current Value of a Future $1?
  * "If you give me money now, I promise I'll give you money in a year." How much should you expect?
    * Look at alternatives:
      * How much does bank give you?
  * Intrinsic value
    * "future income generated by the asset, and discounting it to the present value."
    * `sum(dividend * gamma ^ i) = dividend * 1/(1-gamma)`

##### 1.2

* One way of evaluating a company: information and news
* News informs traders about the company's capacity to make money in the future
* Local and Global Affects -- kinda missed this part

##### Opinion

* Interesting example of an Event Study based from a Journal of Economic Literature

##### 1.3

* What's a company worth?
* Fundamental analysis
  * Book value + future return (aka instrinsic value)
* What's a company worth?
  * Why not ask the market?
  * value = # shares outstanding * price
  * Efficient market hypothesis

### Module 2

#### 2.1

* CAPM
  * introduced in 1966
  * lead the 'index investing' movement
  * assumptions
    * return on stock has two components
      * systematic (the market)
      * residual
    * expected value of residual = 0
    * market return:
      * risk free rate of return +
      * excess return
* Another way to understand CAPM is via this series of videos: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWsEJYPSw0k>â€Ž

#### 2.2

* Recap of CAPM -- very hard to understand
