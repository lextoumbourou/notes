## Essential Reading

Croft, A. and R. Davison Foundation maths. (Harlow: Pearson, 2016) 6th edition. Chapters 30 and 31.

* [[Arithmetic Mean]]
    * Set of values found by adding up all values and dividing by total number of values in the set.
        * $\text{mean} = \frac{\text{sum of the values}}{\text{total number of the values}}$
    * In advanced branches of math, there's special notation for the mean.
        * Given $n$ values, we call them $x_1, x_2, ... x_n$
        * The mean of the values is written as x bar or $\bar{x}$
        * We could express the mean as: $\text{mean} = \bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... x_n}{n}$
        * Or use sigma notation:
            * $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum\limits^{n}_{i=1} x_1}{n}$
    * Given a [[Frequency Table]] the mean is found by first multiplying each value by its frequency, the sum all the frequency and divide the sum of all the former values by the latter.
* [[Median]]
    * Found by listing numbers in ascending order and selecting values that lies halfway along the list.
    * When there is an even number of values, the mean is found by taking the average of the 2 middle values.
* [[Mode]]
    * Set of values that occurs most often.

### Self Assessment 30.2

1. State the 3 different types of average commonly used in statistical calculations.

mean, median, mode

2. Even number of employees, so 18,500 is the average of the 2 middle points.

* [[Variance]] and [[Standard Deviation]]
    * Contain information about the spread of the data, which the mean does not provide.
