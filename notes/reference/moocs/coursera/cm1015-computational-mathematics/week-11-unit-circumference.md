## Essential reading

Croft, A. and R. Davison Foundation maths. (Harlow: Pearson, 2016) 6th edition. Chapters 23 and 24,

The trigonometrical functions and their graphs and Trigonometric identities.

* Generally a right-angled triangle is used to define trigonometrical ratios. However, since the angle $\theta$ is limited to a maximum value of 90Â°, we need an extended definition.
* [[Quadrants]]
    * The x and y axis divide plane into four quadrants.

        * The origin is O. We considern an arm OC that can rotate into any of the quadrants. IN Fig 23, it's in 1.
        * We measure the anticlock angle from position x axis to the arm an call this angle $\theta$.
        * When measured in a clockwise direction from the positive x axis, when take a negative angle.
    * [[Projections]]
        * We consider the x and y projections of the arm OC.
            * We label the x projection OB and the y projection OA.
                * One or both of thes eprojections can be nagetive, depending upon the position of the arm OC.
                * However, the length of the arm itself is awlys considered to be positive.
    * Teh rigonometrical ratios are:
        * ![](../../../../journal/_media/week-11-unit-circumference-trig-ratios.png)
    * Cos(\theta) - x-coordinate of projection
    * Sin(\theta) - y-coordinate
    * tan(\theta) = y-coordinate / x projection
* When you project in the first quadrant, sin and cosine will be position.
* In the 2nd quadrant, the x will be negative (cos < 0) and y (sin) will be position
* In the 3rd quadrant, the x will be negative (cos < 0) and y (sin) will be negative.
* In the 4th quadrant, the x will be positive and y will be negative.
* It is possible to have value outside range 0 to 360 degrees. Adding or subtracting 360 from an angle is equivalent to rotating armg. Which leaves posiiton unchanges.
    * sin \theta = sin(
