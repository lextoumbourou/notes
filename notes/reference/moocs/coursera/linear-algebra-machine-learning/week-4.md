## Matrices make linear mappings

### Matrices as objects that map one vector onto another; all the types of matrices

#### Introduction: Einstein summation convention and the Symmetry of the dot product

* Einstein Summation Convention (00:00-04:24)
    * We can represent a [Matrix Multiplication](../../../../permanent/matrix-multiplication.md) between matrix $A$ and matrix $B$ like this:

        $\begin{bmatrix}a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}b_{11} & b_{12} & b_{13} \\ b_{21} & b_{22} & b_{23} \\ b_{31} & b_{32} & b_{33}\end{bmatrix} = AB$

        We can think of one of the elements in row 2, column 3 of $AB$ as:

        ${(ab)}_{23} = a_{21}b_{13} + a_{22}b_{23} + a_{23}b_{33}$

        We can rewrite that as the sum of elements $j$:

        $ab_{ik} = \sum\limits_{j} a_{ij} \cdot b_{jk}$

        In Einstein's convention, if you have a repeated index like $j$ you can remove it alongside the Sigma notation:

        $ab_{ik} = a_{ij} \cdot b_{jk}$

        The Einstein Summation Convention also describes a way to code [Matrix Multiplication](../../../../permanent/matrix-multiplication.md).

* [Matrix Multiplication](../../../../permanent/matrix-multiplication.md) with rectangular matrices (04:24-05:55)
    * We can multiply rectangular matrices as long as the columns in the first are equal to the rows in the 2nd.

        $A_{(2 \times 3)} \cdot B_{(3 \times 4)}$

        The Einstein Summation Convention shows those operations work. As long as both matrices have the same number of $j$s, you can do it.

        $C_{ik} = a_{ij}b_{jk}$

* [Dot Product](../../../../permanent/dot-product.md) revisited using Einstein's Summation Convention (05:55-07:14)
    * The dot product between vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ in the summation convention is: $u_{i}v_{i}$
    * We can also consider a dot product a matrix product of a row vector and a column vector:

        ![Dot product as matrix multiplication](/_media/laml-dot-product-as-matrix-mult.png)

        So there's some equivalence between [Matrix Multiplication](../../../../permanent/matrix-multiplication.md) and the [Dot Product](../../../../permanent/dot-product.md).

* Symmetry of the [Dot Product](../../../../permanent/dot-product.md) (07:15-09:32)
    * If we have unit vector $\hat{u} = \begin{bmatrix}u_1 \\ u_2\end{bmatrix}$ and we do a projection onto one of the axis vectors: $\hat{e_1} = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}$, we get a length of $u_1$

        ![Projection onto axis vectors](/_media/laml-projection-axis-vector.png)

        * If we then project $e_1$ onto $\hat{u}$, we can draw a line of Symmetry between where the two projections cross:

            ![Symmetry of dot product](/_media/laml-symmetry-of-dot-product.png)

            * The two triangles on either side are the same size, proving that the projection is the same length in either direction. So that proves the [Dot Product](../../../../permanent/dot-product.md) is symmetrical and also that projection is the [Dot Product](../../../../permanent/dot-product.md).
                * That explains why matrix multiplication with a vector is considered a projection onto the vectors composing the matrix (the matrix columns).

## Matrics transform into the new basis vector set

### Matrics changing basis

* Transforming a [Vector](../../../../permanent/vector.md) between [Basis Vectors](../../../../permanent/basis-vectors.md) (00:00-08:31)
    * We can think of the columns of a transformation matrix, as the axes of the new basis vectors described in our coordinate system.
        * Then, how do we transform a vector from one set of basis vectors to another?
    * If we have 2 basis vectors that describe the world of Panda bear in at $\begin{bmatrix}3 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$. Noting that these vectors are describes in the normal coordinate system with basis vectors $\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}$

        ![Pandas basis vectors](/_media/laml-pandas-basis-vectors.png)

        * In Panda's world, those basis vectors are $\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$
    * If we have a vector described in Panda's world as $\frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix}3 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$, we can get it in our frame, by multiplying with Panda's basis vectors:
        $\begin{bmatrix}3 & 1 \\ 1 & 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}\frac{3}{2} \\ \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}5 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$
        * Which begs the question: how can we translate between Panda's world into our world?
    * Using the [Matrix Inverse](../../../../permanent/matrix-inverse.md) of Panda's basis vector matrix we can get our basis in Bear's world:

        $B^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix}1 & -1 \\ -1 & 3\end{bmatrix}$

        * If we use that to transform the vector in our world, we should get it in Bear's world.

            $\frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix}1 & -1 \\ -1 & 3\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}5 \\ 2\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\frac{3}{2} \\ \frac{1}{2}\end{bmatrix}$

* Translate between basis vectors using projections (08:32-11:14)
    * If the new basis vectors are orthogonal then we can translate between bases using only the dot product.

### Doing a transformation in a changed basis

* Doing a transformation of a [Vector](../../../../permanent/vector.md) in a changed basis (00:00-04:13)
    * How would you do a 45Â° rotation in Panda's basis?
    * You could first do it in a normal basis.

        $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}1 & -1 \\ 1 & 1\end{bmatrix}$

    * And multiply that by the vector in our basis:

        $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}1 & -1 \\ 1 & 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}3 & 1 \\ 1 & 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y\end{bmatrix}$

    * That gives us the transformation in our basis vector. You can then multiply that by the inverse of the coordinate matrix, to get it in Panda's coordinate system.

        $\frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix}1 & -1 \\ -1 & 3\end{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}1 & -1 \\ 1 & 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}3 & 1 \\ 1 & 1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y\end{bmatrix}$

    * In short: $B^{-1} R B = R_{b}$

## Making Multiple Mappings, deciding if these are reversible

### Orthogonal matrices

* [Matrix Transpose](Matrix Transpose) (00:15-01:08)
    * An operation where we interchange the rows and columns of a matrix.
    * ${A^{T}}_{ij} = A_{ji}$
    * $\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4\end{bmatrix}^{T} = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 3 \\ 2 & 4\end{bmatrix}$
* [Orthonormal Basis Set](../../../../permanent/orthonormal-basis-set.md) (01:09-06:35)
    * If you have a square matrix with vectors that are basis vectors in new space, with the condition that the vectors are orthogonal to each other and they're unit length (1)
        * In math:
            $a_i \cdot a_j = 0, i \neq j$
            $a_i \cdot a_j = 1, i = k$
        * When you multiple one of these matrices by their transpose, the identity matrix is returned.
            * That means $A^{T}$ is a valid identity for these examples.
        * A matrix composed of these is called [Orthogonal Matrix](permanent/orthogonal-matrix.md).
        * The transpose of these matrices is another orthogonal matrix.
        * The determinant of these is 1 or -1.
        * In Data Science, we want an orthonormal basis set where ever possible.

## Recognising mapping matrices and applying these to data

### The Gram-Schmidt process

* [Gram-Schmidt Process](../../../../permanent/gram-schmidt-process.md) (00:00-06:07)
    * If you have vector set $v = {v_1, v_2 ... v_n}$ that span your space and are linear independent (don't have a determinate of 0) but aren't orthogonal or unit length, you can convert them into an Orthonormal Basis Set using the Gram-Schmidt Process.
    * Process:
        * Take the first vector in the set, $v_1$ and normalise so it's of unit length giving you $e_1$ the first basis vector: $e_1 = \frac{v_1}{|v_1|}$
        * We can think of $v_2$ as having a component in the direction of $e_1$ and a component that's perpendicular.

            ![e2 in Gram-Schmidt](/_media/laml-v2-in-gram-schmidt.png)

            * We can find the component in the direction of $e_1$ by finding the vector projection of $v_2$ onto $e_1$: $\frac{v_2 \cdot e_1}{|e_1|}$
                * To get as a vector we multiply by $e_1$ (noting that it's already of unit length): $\frac{v_2 \cdot e_1}{|e_1|} e_1$
                * We know that $v_2$ is equal to that + the perpendicular component: $v_2 = \frac{v_2 \cdot e_1}{|e_1|} e_1 + u_2$
                 * We can rearrange the expression to find $u_2$: $u_2 = v_2 - (v_2 \cdot e_1) e_1$
                * If we normalise $u_2$: $\frac{u_2}{|u_2|}$ the result is $e_2$
        * Now to find $e_3$, which we know isn't a linear combination of $e_1$ and $e_2$:
            * We can project is onto the plane of $e_1$ and $e_2$, which will result in a vector in the plane composed of $e_2$ and $e_1$s.
            * We can then find the components of $v_3$ that aren't made up of $v_1$ and $v_2$:
                * $u_3 = v_3 - (v_3 \cdot e_1)e_1 - (v_3 \cdot e_2)e_2$
                * If we normalise $u_3$, we get $e_3$: $e_3 = \frac{u_3}{|u_3|}$ we have another unit vector that's normal to the plane.
        * We can keep doing this through all $v_n$ until we have basis vectors that span the space.

### Example: Reflecting in a plane

* Example: performing a rotation on a vector with an unfamilar plane.
    * Create Orthogonal Matrix plane with Gram-Schmidt Process.
* Challenge: performing a rotation on a vector with an unfamiliar plane.
    * You know 2 vectors in the space: $\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 1 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$
    * You have a 3rd vector out of the mirror's plane: $\begin{bmatrix}3 \\ 1 \\ -1\end{bmatrix}$
    * First part, find basis vectors:
        * Find $e_1$: normalise $v_1$ to find $e_1$: $e_1 = \frac{v_1}{|v_1|} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$
        * Then $e_2$, starts with $u_2$: $u_2 = v_2 - (v_{2} \cdot e_{1}) * e_{1}$ then normalise that.
        * Lastly, $e_3$: is the normalised: $u_3 = v_3 - (v_{3} \cdot e_{1}) e_{1}  - (v_{3} \cdot e_{2}) e_{2}$
        * Result is a transformation matrix described by the basis refactors: $E = \begin{bmatrix}(e_1) & (e_2) & (e_3) \end{bmatrix} = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ -1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 1 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} \right)$
        * We can rotate a vector by 45Â° in a single plane, we can flip only the third column vector: $T_{E} = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1\end{bmatrix}$
    * Now, we need to use this to convert a vector $r$ and want to apply to a transformation matrix but in a different space to make: $r'$
        * Going from $r$ to $r'$ is hard.
        * But if you first convert $r$ into the $e$ basis, then apply transformation and convert back into $r$, it's easy:

            ![Reflecting in a plane](/_media/laml-reflecting-in-a-plane.png)

            * $E T_{E} E^{-1} r = r'$
    * Because $e$ is orthonormal, we know the transpose is the inverse.
