These are my notes from [Discrete Mathematics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/) by the University of London.

I took it as part of the BSc Computer Science degree from Oct 2022 - March 2023.

The books required:

* [Kenneth, H, Rosen. Discrete Mathematics and its Applications. (2012) Global Edition](https://www.amazon.com.au/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Kenneth-Rosen/dp/0072899050)
* [David Mackinson, Sets, Logic and Maths for Computing, Springer Verlag. 2012](https://www.amazon.com/Computing-Undergraduate-Topics-Computer-Science/dp/1447124995)

## Intro

* [Discrete Maths](../../../../permanent/discrete-maths.md)
    * The study of discrete objects.
    * Discrete objects are different from "connected objects".
        * separated and distance from each other
        * examples: integer, positions, set, relationships, functions
    * Increasingly applied to practical fields of math and science.
    * Improves reasoning and problem-solving.
* Course instructor is [Dr Lahcen Ouarbya](https://www.gold.ac.uk/computing/people/l-ouarbya/).
