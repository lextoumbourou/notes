## 1.104 The definition of a set

* [Set Theory](../../../../permanent/set-theory.md)
    * a branch of maths about well-defined collections of objects.
    * concept of sets by [Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor), a German mathematician.
    * forms the basis of other fields:
        * counting theory
        * relations
        * graph theory
        * finite state machines
* [Set](../../../../permanent/set.md)
    * a collection of any kind of "well-defined" objects:
        * people, ideas, numbers etc.
    * Set is *unordered* and contains *unique* objects.
    * Examples and notation:
        * Set of positive even integers < 10: $E = \{2, 6, 4, 8\}$
        * Set of vowels in English alphabet: $V = \{a, e, i, o, u\}$
        * Set of colours: $C = \{red, green, blue\}$
        * Empty set (a set containing nothing): $\{\}$ = $\emptyset$
    * In math notation, use $\in$ to represent that something is element of set:
            * $2 \in E$.
    * Use $\notin$ if not an element of set:
        * $3 \notin E$.
* [Cardinality](../../../../permanent/cardinality.md)
    * Given set $S$, the cardinality of $S$ is the number of elements contained in $S$.
    * Write cardinality as $|S|$
    * Example: $|C| = 3$
* [Subset](../../../../permanent/set-subset.md)
    * Express as: $\subseteq$
        * Latex: `\subseteq`
    * $A$ is a subset of $B$ if and only if every element of $A$ is also in $B$.
        * $A \subseteq B$.
    * This gives us equivalence:
        * $A \subseteq B \iff x \in A \text{ then } x \in B \text{(for all x)}$
    * Any set is a subset of itself: $S \subseteq S$
* [Empty Set](../../../../permanent/empty-set.md)
    * is a subset of any set $\emptyset \subseteq S$
    * empty set is a subset of itself: $\emptyset \subseteq \emptyset$
* [Special Sets](../../../../permanent/special-sets.md)
    * $\mathbf{N}$ = set of natural numbers = $\{1, 2, 3, 4, ...\}$
    * $\mathbf{Z}$ = set of integers = $\{..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, ...\}$
    * $\mathbf{Q}$ = set of rational numbers (of form a/b where a and b are elements of Z and b $\ne$ 0)
    * $\mathbf{R}$ = set of real numbers
    * $\mathbf{N} \subseteq \mathbf{Z} \subseteq \mathbf{Q} \subseteq \mathbf{R}$

## 1.106 The listing method and rule of inclusion

* [Set Representation Methods](../../../../permanent/set-representation-methods.md)
    * [Listing Method](../../../../permanent/set-listing-method.md)
    * [Set Builder Notation](../../../../permanent/set-builder-notation.md)
* [Listing Method](../../../../permanent/set-listing-method.md)
    * Represent a set $S$ using all elements of set $S$.
    * Examples:
        * Set of all vowels in English alphabet.
            * $S1 = \{a, e, i, o, u\}$
        * Set of all positive integers less than 10.
            * $S2 = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$
* [Set Builder Notation](../../../../permanent/set-builder-notation.md)
    * Examples:
        * Set of all even integers: { ..., -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6 ... }
            * $\text{Even} = \{2n | n \in Z \}$
            * $\text{Odd} = \{2n+1 | n \in Z \}$
        * Set of rational numbers $Q$: { ..., 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ... }
            * $Q = \{ \frac{n}{m} | n,m \in \text{Z and m }\neq 0 \}$
        * Set of things in my bag: {pen, book, laptop, ...}
            * $\text{Bag =} \{x|x \text{ is in my bag } \}$
    * Exercise
        * Rewrite the following sets using listing method
            * $S_1 = \{ 3n | n \in N \text{ and } n < 6\}$
                * $S_1 = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15}$
            * $S_2 = \{2^n|n \in Z \text{ and } 0 \leq n \leq 4 \}$
                * $S_2 = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}$
            * $S_3 = \{2^{-n}|n \in Z \text{ and } 0 \leq n \leq 4 \}$
                * $S_3 = \{1,\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, ... \}$
        * Rewrite the following sets using set building method
            * $S_1 = \{ \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{8}, ... \}$
                * $S_1 = {\frac{1}{2n} | n \in \text{Z and } 0 < n \leq 5}$

## 1.108 The Powerset of a set

* [Powerset](../../../../permanent/set-powerset.md)
    * A set can have another set as its element.
            * $\{5, 6\} \in \{\{5, 6\}, \{7, 8\}\}$
            * $\{5,6\} \subseteq \{5, 6, 7\}$
    * A set containing all subsets of another set.
    * The powerset of $S$ is $P(S)$ which is the set containing all subsets of $S$.
    * Example
        * $S = \{1, 2, 3\}$
        * $P(S) = \{ \emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\},\{3\},\{1, 2\},\{1, 3\}, \{2, 3\}, \{1, 2, 3\} \}$
    * Exercise 1
        * $S = \{ a, b \}$
        * $P(S) = \{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a, b\} \}$
        * $\{a\} \in P(S)$
        * $\emptyset \subseteq P(S)$ - empty set is subset of $P(S)$
        * $\emptyset \in P(S)$ - empty set is also in $P(S)$
    * Exercise 2
        * $P(\emptyset) = ?$
        * $P(P(\emptyset)) = ?$
        * Powerset of empty set is set containing empty set: $P(\emptyset) = \{ \emptyset \}$
        * Empty set is the only subset of the empty set: $\emptyset \subseteq \emptyset$
        * Empty set is a set subset of the power set of empty set: $\emptyset \subseteq P(\emptyset)$
        * $P(P(\emptyset)) = \{ \emptyset, \{ \emptyset \} \}$
    * Cardinality of a powerset
        * $|P(S)| = 2^{|S|}$
            * $S = \{1, 2, 3\}$, $|S| = 3$, $|P(S)| = 2^3 = 6$
            * $P(S) = \{ \emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1, 2\}, \{2, 3\} \}$

## 1.110 Set operations

* [Union](../../../../permanent/union.md)
    * The union of two sets are all element in *either* A or B.
    * Notion: $A \cup B$
    * Latex operator `\cup`
        * "The U thing"
    * Set builder: $A \bigcup B = \{ x | x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \}$
    * Python example:

            A = {1, 2}
            B = {2, 3}
            A.union(B)
            # {1, 2, 3}

    * Think of a union between people: it's when people come together to make up a larger set.
    * Membership table
        * Show all combinations of sets an element can belong to.
            * Put 1 if element belongs to set.
            * Put 0 if it doesn't

 | $A$   | $B$    | $A \cup B$    |
 | --- | ---  | ---    |
 | 0   | 0    | 0       |
 | 0   | 1    | 1       |
 | 1   | 0    | 1       |
 | 1   | 1    | 1       |


* [Intersection](../../../../permanent/intersection.md)
     * Notion: $A \cap B$
     * Set builder: $A \cap B = \{ x | x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \}$
     * Looks like a horse shoe. The kind you'd take to a dirt road intersection.
     * Think of an intersection between roads: it's the part of road that both of them share.
     * Membership table

 | $A$   | $B$    | $A \cup B$    |
 | --- | ---  | ---    |
 | 0   | 0    | 0       |
 | 0   | 1    | 0       |
 | 1   | 0    | 0       |
 | 1   | 1    | 1       |


* [Set Difference](../../../../permanent/set-difference.md)
    * Elements in $A$, but not $B$.
        * $A - B = \{ x | x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B \}$
    * Example:
        * $\{1, 2\} - \{2, 3\} = \{1\}$
    * Membership table:

 | $A$   | $B$    | $A \cup B$    |
 | --- | ---  | ---    |
 | 0   | 0    | 0       |
 | 0   | 1    | 0       |
 | 1   | 0    | 1       |
 | 1   | 1    | 0       |


* [Symmetric Difference](../../../../permanent/set-symmetric-difference.md)
    * Elements in $A$ or in $B$ but not in both.
        * $A \oplus B = \{ x | (x \in A \text{ or } x \in B) \text{ and } x \notin A \cap B \}$
    * Latex: `\oplus`
    * Can think of it as union of A and B, with all the common elements of A and B removed.
        * $A \oplus B = (A \cup B) - (A \cap B)$
    * Example:
        * A = {1, 2, 3}
        * B = {3, 4, 5}
        * $A \oplus B = \{ 1, 2, 4, 5 \}$
    * Membership table

| $A$ | $B$ | $A \cup B$ |
| --- | --- | ------------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0             |
| 0   | 1   | 1             |
| 1   | 0   | 1             |
| 1   | 1   | 0             |
