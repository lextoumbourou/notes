# Lesson 6: Normal Distribution

* PDF - Probability Density Function (actual formula not covered)
    1. Find a position on x-axis of distribution called x
    2. Area of curve before x is probability of selecting a value less than X

    * If probability less than 0.8 (or 80%) then say "x is 80th percentile"
* 68 - 95 - 99.7 rule
    * 68% of values lie within 1 standard deviation of mean
    * 95% within 2
    * 99.7% within 3
* z-table let's you approximate the proportion less than the z-score on a standardized distribution
    * Example:
        1. Find the z-score of a value on x-axis: ```(mu - x) / std_dev```
        2. Find the proportion value on a [z-table](http://lilt.ilstu.edu/dasacke/eco148/ztable.htm)
    * Only works on a normal distribution
