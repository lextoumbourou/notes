# Lesson 1: Intro to Statistical Research Methods

* To have some level of confidence in survey results, you would need to know, at least:
    * how many people were surveryed
    * who was surveyed
    * how the survey was conducted
* Constructs
    * Things that are generally difficult to measure precisely eg:
        * Happiness
        * Hunger
        * Health
* Operational Definition
    * Systems to measure constructs
* Samples & population
    * Average across population is called "population parameter". Denoted by 'mu'
    * Within population there's a "sample" of people.
    * Average for the sample is called "sample statistics". Denoted by 'x-bar'
    * Difference between mu and x-bar is called "sampling error"

    * Obviously, the bigger the sample, the closer the mu is to x-bar population
* Visualize relationship
    * Helps to find correlations between data
* Correlation does not imply causation
    * "No two countries with a McDonald's have ever gone to war since opening the McDonald's" -- Thomas Friedman
* Casual inference
    * To observe pattern between two variables, have to consider "lurking variables"
    * To show relationships, you can do observational studies or surveys
    * To show causation, you'd need to do a "controlled experiment"
* Downsides to surveys
    * Untruthful responses
    * Biased responses
    * People not understanding the questions or refusing to answer
* Controlled Experiments
    * Placebo
        * Allows for a comparison 'control group' to the 'experimental group'
    * Blind
        * Ensures everyone thinks they're the 'experimental group'
    * Double blind
        * Researchers observing results shouldn't know who's in control or experimental to prevent judgement bias
* Independant variable = variable that is changed to test effect on dependant variables
* Dependant variable = variable being tested
