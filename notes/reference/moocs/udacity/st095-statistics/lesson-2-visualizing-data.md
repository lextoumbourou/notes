# Lesson 2: Visualizing Data

* Frequency table

```
Something | Frequency
India     | 10
China     | 14
England   | 100
```

* Relative frequency == proportion
    * Defined as: frequency / total
    * India = 10 / 124 == 0.08
    * Always >= 0 and <= 1
* Percent = proportion * 100
* Histogram
    * Interval/bin/bucket
        * Grouping things like ages: 0 - 19, 20 - 39, 40 - 59
    * Frequency is always y-axis
    * Variable is on x-axis

* Bar graph
    * Different from histogram, each variable is a distinct value
    * x-axis is sometimes categorical rather than numerical/quantitative
* Normal distributions
    * "Peaks in the middle"
* Skewed distributions
    * Peaks toward left or right
