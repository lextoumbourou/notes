* Mode - most common value
* Median - value in the middle
* Mean - average
* Uniform distribution
    * Flat line
    * No mode / multiple modes

```

mu = sum(x) / N
```

* Properties of mean
    * All scores in distribution affect mean
    * Mean can be described with a formula
    * Many samples from pop have similar mean
    * Mean of a sample can be used to make inferences about it
    * Extreme values can drastically alter mean
* Properties of median
    * Robust - not affected by outliers
* Normally distributed data generally has a similar mode, median and mean
