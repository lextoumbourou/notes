# Lesson 5: Standardizing

* If concerned with proportion less than or greater than a certain value, we should use relative frequencies
* Smaller bins can provide more accurate details on histograms, but bin sizes too small, can hide shape of distribution

* Continuous distribution
    * An equation that allows you to calculate proportion between any two values on x-axis of distribution
* Area of normally proportionally distributed data will always be "1" or 100%
* z score
    * number of standard deviations away from the mean on the x-axis

    * Formula:

    ```
    z = (x - mu) / std_dev
    ```

    * Negative z-scores are to the left of the mean (less than the mean)
* Standardize distribution
    * converting the mean to 0 - shift the distribution left or right
    * standard deviation becomes 1
