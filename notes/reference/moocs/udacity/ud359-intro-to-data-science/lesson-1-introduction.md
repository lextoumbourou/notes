# Lesson 1 - Introduction

* Things a data scientist may do
    * Wrangle data
        * Collect data from real world and process it
    * Make data driven predictions
    * Makes reports, visualisations, blogs etc
    * "Take data and find meaning"
    * "Use data to explain and predict behaviour - human or machine"
* Things a ds should have
    * "Inquistive mind"
    * A passion for a particular dataset (NLP etc)
* "Substantive expertise"
    * Know what questions to ask
    * Can interpret data
    * Understands structure of data
* Real world problems solved with ds
    * Netflix - suggesting movies to watch
    * Social media - suggesting friends / people to follow
    * OkCupid, Uber - blogs with anthropological findings
    * Urban Planning
    * Astrophysics
* Tools
    * pandas
        * useful for manupulating data
    * R
* Dataframes
    * 2d-labeled data structure

## Project

### Simple Heuristic

* At first glance, seems to be a fairly straight forward problem
    * if female, they survived
    * otherwise, they dead.
* After completing it, I get message: "Your heuristics was 78.6756453423% accurate."
    * Why 78.68%?

### Complex Heuristic

* Again, fairly straight forward at first glance.
    * Push all important data into variables so I know what I'm playing with
    * Then just follow logic in comments
* Starting to understand heuristic. How accurate was my predictions compared to who actually survived.
    * Something like: (count_survived / count_predicted_to_survive) * 100
    * Does this factor in "false positives"?

### Complex Heuristic

* Opinion
    * Haven't really been provided any tools to help solve this problem as far as instructional videos go.
        * I tried brute forcing the problem for a while before reading the forum for help.
        * A bit annoying that consulting the forums for help usually results in seeing the answer.
        * At this point, I'm going to assume I'm missing a prerequiste. Though I did the statistics course, I think I should go back and brush up on it.

## Opinions

* Light introduction
* ```pandas``` section was really rushed over - clearly the prereq programming knowledge required is quite high
* Project didn't seem to actually be based on a lesson?
