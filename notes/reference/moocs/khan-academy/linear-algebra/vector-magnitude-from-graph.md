Notes from videos from the [Magnitude of vectors](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-vectors/alg-magnitude-vectors/v/example-calcuating-magnitude-of-vector-from-graph) series of Khan Academy videos. 

To understand this, we have to first remember that the [[Physics Perspective of Vectors]] which represents [[Vectors]] as line starting at the [[Origin (Linear Algebra)]].

If a vector doesn't start from the origin, you can calculate the coordinates by subtracting the change in y by the change in x.

## Vector magnitude from graph

* 


Magniture of vector can be calculated using Pythogorian formula:

$\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$
