Notes from Khan Academy series on Vectors and spaces.

## Vector intro for linear algebra

* A vector is something that has magnitude and direction: moving East at 5mph.
* If someone only tells you a thing is moving at 5mph, it's not a vector quantity - it's a scalar quantity.
* How can you visualise this?
    * In 2 dimensional space, you could represent as an arrow that's 5 long and in the right direction.
    * Moving 5 in the horizontal direction, and nothing in the vertical (since we aren't moving up)
* 2d Vectors describe how much something is shifting in the horizonal direction and how much in the vertical dimension.
    * This can be extended into multiple dimensions.
* Vectors are typically represented as a bolded lowercase letter: $\mathbf{v}$ and with a arrow: $\vec{v}$
    * In Linear Algebra context, it's usually written as a column vector: $\begin{bmatrix}5\\0\end{bmatrix}$ which allows for describing higher dimensionality vectors.

## Real coordinate spaces

* Might see professor write something like $\mathbb{R}^2$.
    * That describes the set of all possible 2 tuples of real numbers (aka non-imaginary numbers): the 2d coordinate space.
* You could also have $\mathbb{R}^3$.
* Or $\mathbb{R}^n$ for n-dimensional space.

## Adding vectors algebraically and graphically

* Add the corresponding components of the vectors.
* See [[Vector Addition]]
* Vector addition is commutitative.

## Multiplying a vector by a scalar

* See [[Vector Scaling]]
* $$2 \times \begin{bmatrix}5\\0\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}2*5\\2*0\end{bmatrix}$$
