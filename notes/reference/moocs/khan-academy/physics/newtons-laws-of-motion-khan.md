* [Newton's Laws Of Motion](../../../../permanent/newtons-laws-of-motion.md)
    * Newton's 1st law:
        * "An object at rest remains at rest, or if in motion, remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force."
        * A "net external force" is required for change in velocity, magnitude or direction.
        * Before Galieo and Newton, it was assumed that objects have a tendency to slow down. However, that didn't take into account the various forces that are acting on an object like gravity, friction and air.
        * In deep interstellar space, we could observe an objects natural tendancy for motion when free from other influencers.
        * Force, external force and net force
            * A force is a push or pull exterted on an object by another object.
            * Force is measures in Newtons ($N$)
                * Force in Newtons = (mass in kilograms) x (acceleration in m / s^2)
            * External force
                * A force that originates from outside an object.
                * Force of gravity exerted by Earth on Moon is an external force on the moon.
                * Force of gravity the inner core of moon exerts on outer crust is internal force of moon.
                * Internal forces within an object can't cause a change in that object's overall motion.
            * Net force
                * Written as $\sum{F}$
                * Sum of all vectors acting on object.
                * If rightward force had magnitude of 35N and leftward force had magnitude of 35N, net force would be 0.
        * Intertia
            * The property of a body to remain at rest or in constant motion.
            * Newton's first law is sometimes called law of intertia.
        * Mass
            * The more "stuff" (matter) in something, the more mass it has.
            * Inertia of object is determined by mass - the more mass, the harder to accerate.
    * Newton's 2nd law:
        * Newton's 2nd law defines how much an object will accerate for a net force
            * $a = \frac{\sum{F}}{m}$ (`acceleration = sum_of_forces / mass`)
            * Sometimes written as $F = ma$, however, that gives the misconception that `mass * acceleration` is the force on an object, not simply what the net force equals
        * When force increases so does acceleration. When mass increases, acceleration decreases.
        * Net force
            * Total sum of forces pushing or pulling on object.
            * Forces are vectors so can be separated into horizontal and vertical forces and added separately. For example, if there's opposing vertical force $F_3$ and $F_1$ and opposing horizontal forces $F_2$ and $F_4$, you'd can calculate horizontal and vertical forces separately:
                * $a_x = \frac{\sum{F_x}}{m} = \frac{F_1- F_3}{m}$
                * $a_y = \frac{\sum{F_y}}{m} = \frac{F_2- F_4}{m}$
            * For diagonal forces, you could calculate the horizontal and vertical components using pythagoreaon theory (or just look at the coordinates of the vector).
    * Newton's 3rd law:
        * "If an object A exerts a force on object B, then object B must exert a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction back on object A."
        * If Earth is pulling down on you with a gravitation force of 500 N, you are pulling the Earth with the same force. Earth doesn't accelerate with the force because of its mass.
        * See Newton's 3rd law in action when a swimmer pushes off on a wall: they exert force on the wall and accelerate in the opposite direction.
