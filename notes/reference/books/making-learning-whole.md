## Introduction: A Whole New Ball Game

* When learning baseball, we very quickly learning the whole game.
    * Learned why hitting the ball is important, or how to keep score etc
    * Though you didn't necessarily play full-scale game: a "junior version" was taught (pg. 15)
* Formal learning rarely gives chance to learn whole game early on.
	* When studying arithmetic don't know what the whole game is
	* Learning Civil War facts, no sense of how the facts were discovered, or what someone can do with them
* "Like batting practice without knowing the whole game" (pg. 14)

## Approaching Complexity

* Some learning comes easy
    * Figure out how to navigate shopping centre
    * Learning first language (though it does take a lot of time, it's just the process is part of life)
* Somethings are more challenging
    * Baseball is complicated
    * As is arithmetic, algebra, reading, understanding literature, scientific inquiry etc
    * Also less academic areas: relationships, leadership etc
* Education's most fundamental problem is approaching complexity (pg. 15)
* 2 most popular answers to approaching complexity:
	* Elements first: learn elements now and put them together later
		* Has enormous appeal and feels intuitive to us: it's the way houses are build and how factories operate
		* Elements don't make sense without whole game
			* Some schools take this to the extreme, with no end game whatsoever.
				* Author calls it "elementitis" (pg. 16)
        * Elements-first is okay as short-term strategy, elementitis is when you go weeks or years without seeing whole game
	* Learning about: learn about something first, rather than how to do it.
        * History is usually taught by "learning other people's facts" without interpretation or critical perspective
            * Students end up with very limited understandings, with no real conception about what ideas mean
        * When this is over done, author calls it "endless learning about" aboutitis.
* What's the alternative? The notion of junior version
    * Find a way to show people the "big picture" in a smaller form, so challenges are meaningful
