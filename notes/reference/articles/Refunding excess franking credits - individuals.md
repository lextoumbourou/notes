When dividends are paid to companies, they are taxed with a "system known as imputation".

The tax a company pays is "imputed" or attributed to shareholders.

Company can decide how many franking credits they will attach to dividends.

If you get franking credits, you have to tell the ATO:

* franked amount
* franking credit

For Australian citizens:

* This info can be used to reduce tax liability from all forms of income.
* Refund any excess franking to you after any income tax and Medicare levy liabilities have been met.
