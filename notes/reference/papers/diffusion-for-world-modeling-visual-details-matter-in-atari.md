These are my notes from [Diffusion for World Modeling: Visual Details Matter in Atari](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12399) by Eloi Alonso, Adam Jelley, Vincent Micheli, Anssi Kanervisto, Amos Storkey, Tim Pearce, Fran√ßois Fleuret.

## Overview

This research paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning agent called [DIAMOND](../../permanent/diamond.md) (DIffusion As a Model Of eNvironment Dreams) which uses a [World Model](../../permanent/world-model.md) trained with [Diffusion](../../permanent/diffusion.md).

The paper argues that traditional world models, which compress visual information into discrete latent variables, can lose important details that are crucial for reinforcement learning. To address this issue, DIAMOND utilises [Diffusion Models](../../permanent/diffusion-models.md), which have proven successful in image generation by learning to reverse a noising process.

By applying diffusion models to world modeling, DIAMOND enables agents to learn from experience in a safe and sample-efficient manner, ultimately achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Atari 100k benchmark.

The paper goes on to explore the advantages of this approach through a detailed analysis of different diffusion model frameworks, the impact of the number of denoising steps, and a qualitative comparison to other world models like IRIS.
