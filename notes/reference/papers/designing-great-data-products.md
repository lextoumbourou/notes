* Range of data products emerging based on predictive modelling: weather forecasting, recommendation engines etc
* However, products are just making predictions, not asking what actions can be taken.
* Four-step approach suggested called [[Drivetrain approach]]
    * Based on self-driving vehicles
    * Start by defining clear objective: drive car from A to B autonomously
