## Overview

Introduces [RAISE](../../permanent/raise.md) a [Agentic Reasoning](../../permanent/agentic-reasoning.md) architecture which improves upon frameworks like [ReAct (Agent)](../../../../permanent/react-agent.md) by incorporating a dual-component memory system, mirroring human short-term and long-term memory, to main conversation context and continuity in conversations. Authors propose a detailed agent constrcution scneario, encompassing conversation selection, scene extraction, [Chain-of-Thought Prompting](../../permanent/chain-of-thought-prompting.md) completion and scene augmentation.

Experimental evaluations in a real estate sales context suggest that RAISE has some advantages over traditional agents, demonstrating its potential for broader applications in the AI field.
