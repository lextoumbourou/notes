summary: Notes from paper Reliance on Metrics is a Fundamental Challenge for AI by Rachel Thomas and David Uminsky
---

* Data-driven companies heavily rely on metrics for decision making
* Metrics also play a central role in ML, therefore, the risks are maximised there.
* Examples of instances where metrics have caused problems:
    * Recommender algorithms radicalising viewers
    * Good teachers fired due to algorithmic mistakes
    * Essay grading software rewarding "sophisticated garbage"
* Goodhart's Law, generalised by Marilyn Strathern in 1997, describes the fundamental problem with metrics:

    > "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"

* Paper finds supporting principles:
    * [Proxy Metrics](../../permanent/proxy-metrics.md) what you really care about
    * Metrics can and will be gamed: aka [Metric hacking](Metric hacking)
    * Metrics tend to overemphasis short-term concerns
    * Many online metrics are gathered in highly addictive environment
* Paper proposes framework for healthier use of metrics:
    * Use a wide range of metrics for evaluation
    * Combine metrics with qualitative accounts
    * Involve range of stakeholders, especially those most impacted
