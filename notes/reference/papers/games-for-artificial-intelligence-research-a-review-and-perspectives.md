*My summary of [Games for Artificial Intelligence Research: A Review and Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13269v4) by Chengpeng Hu, Yunlong Zhao, Ziqi Wang, Haocheng Du, Jialin Liu*

"Games have been the perfect test-beds for artificial intelligence research for the characteristics that widely exist in real-world scenarios."
"GAMES have played an essential role in the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI). As a controllable, cost-effective, and realistic simulator [1], games provide virtual worlds for AI to explore."

"Learning and optimisation, decision making in dynamic and uncertain environments, game theory, planning and scheduling, design and education are common research areas shared between games and real-world problems"
"A variety of real-life problems, such as real-time decision making [2], [3], scheduling [4], design [5], [6] and education [7], can be reflected in such virtual worlds"

This paper reviews the games and game-based platforms for AI research, provides guidenace on matching types of AI with suitable games.

Games have naturally become the perfect testbeds to verify and explore the ability, generality, robustness and safety of AI [8]â€“[10]. Games or game-based platforms have provided an ideal playground for AI researchers to study, explore, evaluate and experiment with different ideas in a controllable and safe environment [5], [11]. Such games and platforms also enable us to study and answer what-if questions that are hard to do safely in the real world. They can even stimulate researchers to ask new research questions.
