*My summary of the paper [Mathematical discoveries from program search with large language models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06924-6) by Bernardino Romera-Paredes, Mohammadamin Barekatain, Alexander Novikov, Matej Balog, M. Pawan Kumar, Emilien Dupont, Francisco J. R. Ruiz, Jordan S. Ellenberg, Pengming Wang, Omar Fawzi, Pushmeet Kohli & Alhussein Fawzi*

This paper introduces [FunSearch](../../permanent/funsearch.md) (short for searching in the function space), which is a system to allow LLMs to improve code generated by an LLM, by continually reprompting the LLM with past context, selecting context based on an evolutionary procedure.

They apply FunSearch the cap set problem, from combinatorics and find we discover new constructions of large cap sets going beyond the best-known ones, both in finite dimensional and asymptotic cases.

Later they were able to make additional discoveries in [AlphaEvolve: A coding agent for scientific and algorithmic discovery](alphaevolve-a-coding-agent-for-scientific-and-algorithmic-discovery.md).
