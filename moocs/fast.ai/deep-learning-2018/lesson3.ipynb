    "\n",
    "* The planetary dataset has images with multilabel like `haze`, `water` etc.\n",
    "  * Since we want to predict multithings, softmax isn't so good.\n",
    "* Good practise to \"anthropomorphise your activations functions\":\n",
    "  * Softmax - \"I want to pick a single thing\"\n",
    "* Fast.AI knows what to do under the hood with multilabels.\n",
    "  * It will detect multilabel data and change the underlying activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 01:25:25 - Data object attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data object (`ImageClassifierData`) has these attributes:\n",
    "  * `val_ds` - Validation [Dataset](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset)\n",
    "    * Use to get a single image.\n",
    "  * `val_dl` - Validation [DataLoader](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader)\n",
    "    * Use to get a transformed minibatch.\n",
    "* PyTorch is more Pythonic than Tensorflow, which \"reinvents the wheel\" a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 01:41:17 - f2 metric\n",
    "\n",
    "* f beta function: how much do you weight false negatives vs false positives?\n",
    "* f2: `f beta with beta = 2`\n",
    "  * Used because that's what Planets used for the competition.\n",
    "  * Defined as follows:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    fbeta_score(targets, predictions, 2, average='samples')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "### 01:44:24 - Sigmoid (multilabel activation function)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similar to softmax, but doesn't divide the values by the sum.\n",
    "* It should return a number between 0 and 1.\n",
    "* Allows multiple things to be high.\n",
    "* On the last layer, it's calculated as `math.exp(activiation) / (1 + math.exp(activation))`.\n",

    "* Question 1: why only learn the last layer on the Planet dataset, given how different it is to ImageNet?\n",
    "* Answer 1: to ensure final layer weights aren't random when training earlier layers - they'll likely take longer to train otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Question 2: what is trained when you unfreeze earlier layers - the kernels?\n",
    "* Answer 2: Training in conv layers is training filters/kernels. Only FC layers have trainable weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Question 3: In example of training satellite images, how do you get an that's 64x64?\n",
    "* Answer 3: Depends on the transform. When using data augmentation, it takes a randomly choosen crop.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Question 4: Is the choice of metric different to the loss function?\n",
